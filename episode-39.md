# Episode 39

##SRWQ Mission 39: Sex fixes everything. Sex, and nanomachines

    Continuing from last thread....

"Wait, Arado... What were you doing in my closet?"

"Er... I climbed in through the air vents, and I was going to just wait in the middle of the room for you, but I didn't want to risk that Echidna lady seeing me."

"Oh right... And why are you fiddling with the string of my dress?"

"Er...welll..."

"That string is just decorative. THIS one opens my bodice."

"Oh... ok then..."

---

The Hippo transport is soaking wet, still dripping from the weight of water it was under in its hiding place. The cargo bay opens and a wave of water and Gespenst components flows out, revealing the Assault Lander, covered in seaweed and the odd barnacle, but otherwise intact.

Van Vat Tran waves to the Shadow Mirror engineering staff. "Right, get those Gespensts out of there and array them with the Lions we've recovered! We start the Machine Cell integration as soon as Magus has finished the programming!"

Irm frowns as the Gespensts are ferried towards the vats of grey goo. "Are you sure this is a good idea, Vindel?"

Lemon Browning steps forward to answer the question. "Based on the data gathered from the StealthRaubtier and the Raioh, I've confirmed that a limited deployment of the machine cells will be safe. We'll use up this test batch, and Dr. Nate will refine the formula for later iterations, and make them more stable."

Vindel nods. "We have 14 hours until we have to contact the SRX people. We must have every weapon we can muster by then. After all, the whole reason they spared us is because they think we're strong. So, lets be strong."

---

"Still nothing?"

Gilliam looks up from his console at the face of Ryuune Zoldark. "I'm sorry, Ryuune, but no matter how I adjust it, the interference is just too great. I can't activate the teleportation circuit, and it's looking less and less likely that we'll be able to transport out safely once we find Latooni and Shine."

"The first transport wasn't especially safe..."

"I beleive that was my point. No, it seems, oddly enough, that Duminass was right: There's dimensional interference of some sort making the jump all but impossible. To be sure of making it back, I'd need massive amounts of power, and I'd have to leave a trail between the worlds that Dark Brain could see if he were blind."

"So... are we going to be stuck here then?"

Gilliam grimaces. "Duminass claimed the interference was a 'storm', implying its a natural phenomenon, and that its temporary. Its possible that its merely a delay of a few weeks, and we can hide ourselves until it passes over. If not, we'll have to find some other way."

"Hence why we're keeping the Zweizergain in one piece this time?"

"Don't worry, Ryuune. I'm going to destroy both it and the Giest as soon as we get back. But until then, I'm keeping every advantage we can get..."

---

Tetsuya frowns at his watch. "13 hours left... I'm starting to wonder whether we should just send a rejection now, and get it over with."

Lefina nods on the viewscreen. "Tempting, but the less contact we have with them, the better. We'd had enough issues with this EFA trying to assault us, leaving them messages won't help."

"True... still, the waiting is intolerable. I hope Gilliam finds us a way out of this mess soon, and that the girls show up..."

"Yes... We've been all over this planet, America, Africa, the Pacific, most of Asia... we're running out of places to look."

"Process of elimination... Once we rendevous, there'll really only be Europa left. Heart of the Federation, and supposed source of the Einst threat. That's one trap even we won't want to spring..."

---

"It doesn't feel real..." Hugo stares at the artificial hand, flexing the false fingers.

"I hear that." Kar-Wai scratches at one of the metal nodules along his jaw. "You don't feel like its a real part of the body, even though it moves when your brain says to. It's kinda trippy, alright..."

"No..." The young man looks around the room. "None of THIS feels real... It's like I've had a window open, showing me heaven and hell, and now someone's put a cheap painting in front of it... And I want it to be real, don't get me wrong..."

Kai puts a shaky hand on Hugo's shoulder. "Don't worry Red, you'll get through this. We got you out of there, and we're gearing up to show those aliens what we think of their shit. You'll be ready for the big fight, wontcha? And Aqua too, she'll come right as well. Now buck, and get yourself better."

Kar-Wai Lau watched as Kai got up and left. He'd seen that trick before. He'd used it on the young Kai himself, more than once. But false reassurances weren't going to fix someone as traumatised as this man, and the girl...

"Er... Best wishes, Hugo. I need to find Rand..."

---

"Ow!" Axel looks at his finger in surprise, then pokes the Soulgain again. "OW!!"

Lamia looks perplexed at this repetitive behaviour. "And this isn't jogging your memory at all? Your spirit is meant to be linked to this mech, Axel, and you have no memory of it?"

"I wouldn't say that exactly. It certainly feels... fulfilling when I look at it. Kinda want to get it fixed up and hop into it, but if it keeps zapping me every time I touch it..." He tries another exploratory fingerpoke. "OOOWWW!!!"

"Nothing... not even Lemon..."

"Yeah, what was with that chick? She looked really hurt when she saw me. And she looked kinda pissed at you too, now that I recall..."

Lamia folds her arms awkwardly over her ample chest. "Er... I'll tell you some other time, Axel. For now lets... lets just take a walk."

Vindel scowls as the failed W-Series and the damaged pilot walk through the exit nonchalantly. "...Such a waste, and in a time of great need too."

"Typical callousness on your part, Vindel." Manami Hamill walks up behind the Shadow Mirror leader, her partner Aisha behind her. "You only see their imperfections, their issues, not their potential. I thought people bringing out their potential through war was your whole philosophy."

"Mankind bringing out its potential through conflict. Individual people, and androids, aren't meant to exemplify my ideals, merely to form as a consqeuence of nations and factions striving for greater things. And it doesn't have to be outright war, despite what most people say. Trade disputes, simple politics, things Earth is losing because of the EFA's influence."

"But right now, it has to be a war."

"Or something very like it. We'll need your troops in Europe, Hamill, everything you can muster. You may have the plans for the Ashsaber, you've certainly gotten a good look while repairing it. And a small sample of Machine Cells as well, to utilise as yo-"

"No. The ELF won't be messing around with some goop you scraped off the behind of an interdimensional turkey."

Vindel gasps. "How did you-"

"A lady keeps her secrets."

"...Fine. But be ready, Hamill. This is going to be the big one, and we'll need you along with everyone else."

"Just make sure you've got our backs this time, Vindel. I'd hate to see a repeat of... that incident." The two women turn and leave.

---

Van Vat Tran and Lily Junkers stare holes in each other across the table, completely ignoring the giant image of Ryuune Zoldark on the monitor. The younger woman sighs.

"Well I can see you two are still getting on like a house on fire... Mr Mauser, I assume you're trying to unite us all into one big happy family again?"

"Something like that... First, I'd like to thank you for the support you gave our people after the incident at TLI. That was generous of you."

"No problem. Given how much we've gotten out of it, it was no trouble."

Vindel cocks an eyebrow, then continues. "Ms Zoldark, my group will be participating in a operation soon, which, if successful, will see the EFA toppled at last. We need support on this operation, which only the DC can truly provides. Vat Trans caches of troops, Junkers' supply network, and your intelligence network, all could be vital in the upcoming events. Hence why I'd like to try, one more time, for you to listen to me, and agree to work together once more."

"You've tried three times before. Whats different this time?"

"The proof, my dear, that your father was right all along."

"...That does change things. Tell me more..."

---

Two hours later:

"Wow, thats a racy getup...I like it."

Ryuune looks from the her in a business suit to her own clothes. "Er, you really think so? It's just something I'm comfortable with, it's nothin-"

"WOAH!" Arado rushes up as the DC technicians finish pulling the WildWurger from the depths of the cargo hold. "It's completely fixed! And you replaced the jacket armor! Awesome!"

Ryuune bows respectfully. "The least I could do for all the info you guys have been lavishing on me. Mr Feinschmeckers deal is the best things that's happened to California branch in ages."

Gilliam climbs down onto the cargo ships deck. "Speaking of which, Ms Zoldark, you said there were some things we needed to know?"

"...Vindel Mauser is back in charge of the Shadow Mirror. And he's going to take the Izu Base deal, as are Vat Tran and Junkers."

Gilliam pinches his nose. "It seems Mauser is destined to be our foe, in any time or world..."

"But theres some good news as well! We found your little lost lambs!"

Interesting fact: "feet" was sometimes used as a euphemism for "crotch" in Hebrew lore. So it's possible seraphim had wings covering their (lack of) bits instead of their actual feet.

If we made full-on Seraphg it would need a crotch-cannon.

It's not that it's new, it's just that if we do go for crotch wings we need to hide a cannon under them. Otherwise, what's the point?

Head wings/Shoulder wings/Waist wings.

All fold around the body when mech is in storage, hiding its form from sight. Waist wings stay wrapped around body at most times, hiding the crotch cannon. The back wings also function as a mount for the funnels.

Talk to Arado. Confide in him about everything we know so far, tell him we want to find a way to fix it. Ask him what he thinks we should try to do.

After we've got his opinion alone, call Dumi and speak with both of them together.

I'm for skipping out to the Frontier for a while to have adventures in and provide a private, safe laboratory for Sophia. I'm -against- going to other places, I don't think we'll actually recruit anyone, there's very few places that would have any tech we would want, and it will almost certainly cause us even more problems. In short, it will be a colossal waste of time and a source of great headaches.

Arado mumbles into the nape of your neck. "Like what? I don't really know, I've been dead most of it."

"...After I....killed you, they threw me out of the School. They erased my memories and threw me out onto the streets of some Italian city. I could barely speak English, let alone Italian."

"Huh, So apparently I wasn't useless...knew Latooni was full of shit..."

"I was living as a street bum, in one of the richest cities in the world...Then a nice man called Grims found me. Took me in, got me back to full health again. For a while, that other me thought I could make a new life...Then the memories came back, and I started getting...angry again."

"Your old temper...Yeah, that couldn't have been good for him."

"I told Grims I was leaving because I respected his pacifism, but the reality was, I didn't want to risk hurting someone so darned nice. I joined the ELF, and I was doing well there, got to pilot one of their Earthgains, and even got to know Boss Hamill a bit. But then, there was the big EFA offensive, Operation Burnished Crown, they called it, because they were cleaning off the gunk around Geneva....Got trashed by a zerg-rush of Gespensts (Big shock), and ended up hiding out in Germany. Then I met Russell..."

Might handle later, after I put another dent in the massive queue I've currently got.

The most important obstacle for me, at least in the Katina/Deadrado sense, is that we haven't seen how this little encounter will affect their resolve later in the story. This is why I can get away with the fem!Haken tripe and everything else - we already know how the story is SUPPOSED to end, and we're more or less granted an open slate in between the end of EF1 and the start of EXCEED (or LKSH1/W00, given my parallel continuity shenanigans).

...See ya for Thread 40.

"At the time, the Shadow Mirrors plan, to break the world and start endless war...it made sense, y'know. Here was me, someone only good for fighting, wanting revenge on the School and the EFA assholes who set it up. It seemed like a dream job. So once Russell smuggled me out of Europe, we headed straight for TLI. Got there just in time, too."

"You were going to go to another world, Kat?"

"I found out about it as we were getting off the shuttle, Arado. I didn't have time to dwell on it, 10 minutes later I was in an R-Blade fighting the EFA. I figured, why not, it's temporary right. We go there, lose the cops, build ourselves up and head back to kick ass."

"Was that the plan?"

"I don't know...But it didn't matter in the end, because the Irregulars showed up. Apparently, in their future, we'd arrived in their world, set up the Neo DC, and caused havoc, and they'd had to beat us down. No mention of me...I guess I wouldn't have made it across, or died like a bitch flying a Gespenst or something."

"And they wanted revenge?"

"No, Ryuune explained it...they didn't like the Shadow Mirrors, and they'd come expecting they'd have to fight us, but they wanted only to stop us leading Dumis bo-...Actually, now that I think about it, they were expecting Dumi to find the trail we would have made, and call in his boss Dark Brain, to fuck their shit up....Would he really do that?"

A few points to clarify any...inconsistencies. Mentally, Arado is still a 15-year old boy, machine cells constantly replaying his death in his head aside. Physically, he's been improved. Shocker upgraded his physique, so his build would be that of an fully developed 18-20 year old (on top of the School steroids and the cyber-muscles). The W-series treatment, OTOH, upgraded him externally, to make him indistuingishable from a human (aside from the discoloring from the Machine Cells). He is, to put it bluntly, fully functional.

Here's what we need to do.

We need to convince Vindel to somehow bring us along when he makes his deal with Yukiko. Not only that, we have to meet her *in person*.

If Katina's like the Blanks in Warhammer 40K, this might cancel out Yukiko's power while we're around. We can tell Vindel that it's so we're in a position to have some vestige of leverage with Yukiko. Something like that would definitely make Vindel consider taking us out of prison earlier.

... But in reality we're using it so nobody would have a clue that we're getting our friends and company in a position to at least put both of them out of comission. At that point we would need someone we can trust to take control of the Shadow Mirror SRX branch. I might suggest Sophia Nate if only because she seems to have the biggest conscious right now. Hell, we might even be able to get Lemon to work with us if we're lucky.

With someone trustworthy in charge we'd have the manpower to take down the First and Only. After that we worry about the Einst and the Balmarians.

It's certainly an interesting plan, but it's also an enormous gamble. You're betting entirely on Katina's anti-Psychodriver abilities being enough to completely negate Yukiko's -immense- psychic capabilities. You're wrong, and it's game over for Katina, and probably everyone else too.

You nod. "Dumi had been trying to get me there for ages, friendly as anything, but all for his secret purpose, to find his body."

"I'll admit, when he explained what he was to me, I had a hard time beleiving it too. I suppose if he'd been truthful with the rest of you, there'd have been issues."

"I guess I can't blame Dumi for that...He promised he'd still be my partner, and I believe him...But finding out he was a wierd alien, and he'd been doing all this shit behind out backs with Cynth...Sorry, Tis, and the Deathpenis lady...It was wierd. But not as wierd as Juergens, I found."

So long as the mech didn't have a pilot support program or a takeover autopilot, they shouldn't be able to influence a pilot.

"I WANT TO EMBRACE YOU, ALFIMI!"

Adding the likes of the GEIM system would be disastrous, however.

"My, Miss Alfimi...You know just what to say to get a girl interested!!" The Raioh impales itself on the blade, the tip scraping the side of your cockpit, then wraps its arms around the red mech, catching the thing in a tight bear hug.

And...if a particular mech became too infamous, if it had been the killer of hundreds, and people ran in fear at the very mention of its name...

"You're coming home with me, girl. I'm going to strap you to a table and dissect you...with my tongue."

Theres a chance the Cells could use the psychic resonance to self-evolve.

We know that, Katina doesn't. I doubt she'd look at these things in terms of proper familial relationships.

But yes, Juergens' motivation here was essentially the same as his OG version, its just that because he had access to Dumi's technology directly, and DC volunteers for the ODE process, this universes ODE was more benign.

You button up your dress, fix your hair and ribbons, and start tuning in your comm unit. Arado merely throws a blanket over himself as he waits.

The Diamond Eye appears on the screen. Ah, Katina, Arado. Are you....finished?

You look back over at the shirtless Arado sitting up more bed, all sweaty and dishevelled. "...We're taking a break. Dumi, I need to ask you about the Raioh. With the Machine Cells in it, is it...safe for me??"

Hhhmmmmm.....Hhhhmmm.....Hhhmmmm....

"DUMI!"

If I'm nearby, yes. Katina, did something happen while you were over the Indian Ocean?

"Y-yeah, a girl from the First attacked us."

And were you unusually agressive towards her? Did you overreact, or anything?

"Y-yeah, a little."

As I thought. The seal I put on the LIOH system was lifted.

"The Leo...wait, you mentioned this thing before, it's like the GEIM system, isn't it?"

Yes and no. Its a derivative the Shadow Mirrors developed, intended to be much safer and less damaging to the pilot, by using natural methods, such as injecting stimulants and activating the adrenal glands, to hieghten the pilots combat performance, rather than manipulating their mind directly. The standard GEIM system wouldn't work on you anyway.

"And you shut it off? Why?"

Because the first time it activated, in Mexico, you almost overloaded the Raioh's Plasma Convertor. The system couldn't handle you, Katina. It's meant to augment an average pilots aggressiveness to level you hit naturally. The feedback it got from you almost destroyed the Raioh.

"But then, after you left me in China, the Machine Cells reactivated it..."

Katina, I can control the Machine Cells, but not at a a distance. So long as you're within a few kilometers of me, the system should be safe. But if I'm not there, using the Raioh is too dangerous, and it wasn't exactly safe to begin with.

"What about me? Did I get any of the Machine Cells in me?"

No, I've been careful not to expose you, and programmed the Cell not to interact with organic material unless specifically ordered to. Your anti-psychodriver abilities are too pronounced, I wouldn't risk exposing you to them even if I was the kind of callous and ruthless being who'd try to control you.

"Keep buttering yourself up, turkey."

Hey!...No, you should be clean of Machine Cells, and I intend to keep it that way.

"Good...any more luck with the real Cells?"

A little, but we need to properly experiment with the Zehirut Crystal first, and the deployment of the Svartalf and Valkyria units is taking up Sophias time.

"The what-whiches?"

The Machine Cell units based on the Gespensts and Lions we've salvaged. They're being assigned pilots now from the DC crews. They're another thing I'd like to keep my eye on, if I can.
