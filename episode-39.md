Continuing from last thread....

"Wait, Arado...What were you doing in my closet?"

"Er....I climbed in through the air vents, and I was going to just wait in the middle of the room for you, but I didn't want to risk that Echidna lady seeing me."

"Oh right...And why are you fiddling with the string of my dress?"

"Er...welll...."

"That string is just decorative. THIS one opens my bodice."

"Oh...ok then..."
The Hippo transport is soaking wet, still dripping from the weight of water it was under in its hiding place. The cargo bay opens and a wave of water and Gespenst components flows out, revealing the Assault Lander, covered in seaweed and the odd barnacle, but otherwise intact."

Van Vat Tran waves to the Shadow Mirror engineering staff. "Right, get those Gespensts out of there and array them with the Lions we've recovered! We start the Machine Cell integration as soon as Magus has finished the programming!"

Irm frowns as the Gespensts are ferried towards the vats of grey goo. "Are you sure this is a good idea, Vindel?"

Lemon Browning steps forward to answer the question. "Based on the data gathered from the StealthRaubtier and the Raioh, I've confirmed that a limited deployment of the machine cells will be safe. We'll use up this test batch, and Dr. Nate will refine the formula for later iterations, and make them more stable."

Vindel nods. "We have 14 hours until we have to contact the SRX people. We must have every weapon we can muster by then. After all, the whole reason they spared us is because they think we're strong. So, lets be strong."

"Still nothing?"

Gilliam looks up from his console at the face of Ryuune Zoldark. "I'm sorry, Ryuune, but no matter how I adjust it, the interference is just too great. I can't activate the teleportation circuit, and it's looking less and less likely that we'll be able to transport out safely once we find Latooni and Shine."

"The first transport wasn't especially safe..."

"I beleive that was my point. No, it seems, oddly enough, that Duminass was right: There's dimensional interference of some sort making the jump all but impossible. To be sure of making it back, I'd need massive amounts of power, and I'd have to leave a trail between the worlds that Dark Brain could see if he were blind."

"So...are we going to be stuck here then?"

Gilliam grimaces. "Duminass claimed the interference was a 'storm', implying its a natural phenomenon, and that its temporary. Its possible that its merely a delay of a few weeks, and we can hide ourselves until it passes over. If not, we'll have to find some other way."

"Hence why we're keeping the Zweizergain in one piece this time?"

"Don't worry, Ryuune. I'm going to destroy both it and the Giest as soon as we get back. But until then, I'm keeping every advantage we can get..."

Tetsuya frowns at his watch. "13 hours left...I'm starting to wonder whether we should just send a rejection now, and get it over with."

Lefina nods on the viewscreen. "Tempting, but the less contact we have with them, the better. We'd had enough issues with this EFA trying to assault us, leaving them messages won't help."

"True...still, the waiting is intolerable. I hope Gilliam finds us a way out of this mess soon, and that the girls show up..."

"Yes...We've been all over this planet, America, Africa, the Pacific, most of Asia...we're running out of places to look."

"Process of elimination...Once we rendevous, there'll really only be Europr left. Heart of the Federation, and supposed source of the Einst threat. That's one trap even we won't want to spring..."

I posted this in the last thread before checking for a new one. Reposting here.

By the way, we never got timeline issues solved. I shall solve them now, as best I can. I looked at the info on developing the Gespenst in the back of the SRW OGS artbook awhile back and came up with this: Mao started building the first Gespensts in 179, they were finished in 180-181, and the Aggressors were in 181-182 or possibly later, they never mention an end date. Latooni also mentions early on in Ryusei route in OG1 that the Aggressors were formed "a few years earlier", which matches up with this fairly well.

This, of course, makes Tempest a massive fucking plothole, since Hope is stated to be 16 years ago and he acts like the Aggressors were before the Hope Incident. But that also can't be true, because then Elzam and Sanger would be incredibly young and Gilliam wouldn't have crossed over from SMverse. So basically, Tempest is nuts, Aggressors were a couple of years ago. This also works with how they never even got the idea to build humanoid weapons until Meteor 3, seven years ago.

"It doesn't feel real..." Hugo stares at the artificial hand, flexing the false fingers.

"I hear that." Kar-Wai scratches at one of the metal nodules along his jaw. "You don't feel like its a real part of the body, even though it moves when your brain says to. It's kinda trippy, alright..."

"No..." The young man looks around the room. "None of THIS feels real...It's like I've had a window open, showing me heaven and hell, and now someone's put a cheap painting in front of it...And I want it to be real, don't get me wrong..."

Kai puts a shaky hand on Hugo's shoulder. "Don't worry Red, you'll get through this. We got you out of there, and we're gearing up to show those aliens what we think of their shit.

Kar-Wai Lau watched as Kai got up and left. He'd seen that trick before. He'd used it on the young Kai himself, more than once. But false reassurances weren't going to fix someone as traumatised as this man, and the girl...

Not many. We couldn't control the Balmerians allying with the Einst, they did that when our backs were turned. We couldn't save Jayce no matter what happened, it was a flaw with the False Cells we didn't find out until we had already done it. There's not much we can do about Radha in any case, the Shadow Mirrors can't fix her life and we can't convince her to agree with our philosophy.

About the only thing we'd have control over would be allying with Yukiko or not, and the consequences for that are bad no matter what we pick. We're fucked in this story no matter what we do. There's nothing we can fix. even if we try to make something good it will just be fucked up the second we turn our backs. It's discouraging.

This world looks like it's sliding further and further into an UNLIMITED MACHINE CELL CRISIS plot where Machine Cells take over everything, and Sophia goes full-on Magus and tries to take over the world or something. I just hope they don't get a hold of Granzon.

Also, I'd like to point out that Raioh has both killed assloads of people, and also has the LIOH system installed. Probably not a good idea to rely on Machine Cells too much, or we'll start developing berserker tendencies. Like what we already do, but with control of the mech stripped from us, and taken over by a bunch of despair-eating machine cells.

"Typical callousness on your part, Vindel." Manami Hamill walks up behind the Shadow Mirror leader, her partner Aisha behind her. "You only see their imperfections, their issues, not their potential. I thought people bringing out their potential through war was your whole philosophy."

"Mankind bringing out its potential through conflict. Individual people, and androids, aren't meant to exemplify my ideals, merely to form as a consqeuence of nations and factions striving for greater things. And it doesn't have to be outright war, despite what most people say. Trade disputes, simple politics, things Earth is losing because of the EFA's influence."

"But right now, it has to be a war."

"Or something very like it. We'll need your troops in Europe, Hamill, everything you can muster. You may have the plans for the Ashsaber, you've certainly gotten a good look while repairing it. And a small sample of Machine Cells as well, to utilise as yo-"

"No. The ELF won't be messing around with some goop you scraped off the behind of an interdimensional turkey."

Vindel gasps. "How did you-"

"A lady keeps her secrets."

"...Fine. But be ready, Hamill. This is going to be the big one, and we'll need you along with everyone else."

"Just make sure you've got our backs this time, Vindel. I'd hate to see a repeat of...that incident." The two women turn and leave.

My thoughts so far on our Katgelmir:
-Overall frame derived from Valsione, but bustier.
-Outer shell resembles Katina's dress, with several plates folded around the machine in defensive mode - when opened, these form wings on its legs, back, and arms.
-One ribbon worn like a scarf can be ripped off and morphed into a very long, slender bladed weapon.
-I'm on the fence about whether to give it lightning powers like RaiOh or go for something new.

Interesting fact: "feet" was sometimes used as a euphemism for "crotch" in Hebrew lore. So it's possible seraphim had wings covering their (lack of) bits instead of their actual feet.

If we made full-on Seraphg it would need a crotch-cannon.

After we've got his opinion alone, call Dumi and speak with both of them together.

I'm for skipping out to the Frontier for a while to have adventures in and provide a private, safe laboratory for Sophia. I'm -against- going to other places, I don't think we'll actually recruit anyone, there's very few places that would have any tech we would want, and it will almost certainly cause us even more problems.

The most important obstacle for me, at least in the Katina/Deadrado sense, is that we haven't seen how this little encounter will affect their resolve later in the story.

A few points to clarify any...inconsistencies. Mentally, Arado is still a 15-year old boy, machine cells constantly replaying his death in his head aside. Physically, he's been improved. Shocker upgraded his physique, so his build would be that of an fully developed 18-20 year old (on top of the School steroids and the cyber-muscles). The W-series treatment, OTOH, upgraded him externally, to make him indistuingishable from a human (aside from the discoloring from the Machine Cells). He is, to put it bluntly, fully functional.

Here's what we need to do.

We need to convince Vindel to somehow bring us along when he makes his deal with Yukiko. Not only that, we have to meet her *in person*.

If Katina's like the Blanks in Warhammer 40K, this might cancel out Yukiko's power while we're around. We can tell Vindel that it's so we're in a position to have some vestige of leverage with Yukiko. Something like that would definitely make Vindel consider taking us out of prison earlier.

... But in reality we're using it so nobody would have a clue that we're getting our friends and company in a position to at least put both of them out of comission. At that point we would need someone we can trust to take control of the Shadow Mirror SRX branch. I might suggest Sophia Nate if only because she seems to have the biggest conscious right now. Hell, we might even be able to get Lemon to work with us if we're lucky.

With someone trustworthy in charge we'd have the manpower to take down the First and Only. After that we worry about the Einst and the Balmarians.

It's certainly an interesting plan, but it's also an enormous gamble. You're betting entirely on Katina's anti-Psychodriver abilities being enough to completely negate Yukiko's -immense- psychic capabilities. You're wrong, and it's game over for Katina, and probably everyone else too.

You nod. "Dumi had been trying to get me there for ages, friendly as anything, but all for his secret purpose, to find his body."

"I'll admit, when he explained what he was to me, I had a hard time beleiving it too. I suppose if he'd been truthful with the rest of you, there'd have been issues."

"I guess I can't blame Dumi for that...He promised he'd still be my partner, and I believe him...But finding out he was a wierd alien, and he'd been doing all this shit behind out backs with Cynth...Sorry, Tis, and the Deathpenis lady...It was wierd. But not as wierd as Juergens, I found."

"Who?"

"This crazy old man, working for Lily Junkers to make her space army. He'd made something out of Dumis body, the ODE system, to connect peoples brain together, and get them all to think as one person....Now he was wierd. He was trying to convince me that if everyone was connected, there'd be no war, no suffering, none of it. The wierdest bullshit I'd ever heard..."

"He wouldn't be wrong, per se...If there was only one real person in the world, that person would never get heartbroken, or angry at another, or try to kill people...But I doubt he'd ever fall in love, or get told jokes, or anything good in life either."

"Yeah, Juergens must have been fucked in the head. But when we shut him down, he said he'd seen Dumi's mind...said it...was too human, that Dumi was making himself retarded or something."

He's full of himself, thinks he's Jesus with better hair, and he doesn't seem to regret the loss of the rest of the Shadow Mirrors at all.

So long as the mech didn't have a pilot support program or a takeover autopilot, they shouldn't be able to influence a pilot.

"I WANT TO EMBRACE YOU, ALFIMI!"

Adding the likes of the GEIM system would be disastrous, however.

"My, Miss Alfimi...You know just what to say to get a girl interested!!" The Raioh impales itself on the blade, the tip scraping the side of your cockpit, then wraps its arms around the red mech, catching the thing in a tight bear hug.

And...if a particular mech became too infamous, if it had been the killer of hundreds, and people ran in fear at the very mention of its name...

"You're coming home with me, girl. I'm going to strap you to a table and dissect you...with my tongue."

Theres a chance the Cells could use the psychic resonance to self-evolve.

You button up your dress, fix your hair and ribbons, and start tuning in your comm unit. Arado merely throws a blanket over himself as he waits.

The Diamond Eye appears on the screen. Ah, Katina, Arado. Are you....finished?

You look back over at the shirtless Arado sitting up more bed, all sweaty and dishevelled. "...We're taking a break. Dumi, I need to ask you about the Raioh. With the Machine Cells in it, is it...safe for me??"

Hhhmmmmm.....Hhhhmmm.....Hhhmmmm....

"DUMI!"

If I'm nearby, yes. Katina, did something happen while you were over the Indian Ocean?

"Y-yeah, a girl from the First attacked us."

And were you unusually agressive towards her? Did you overreact, or anything?

"Y-yeah, a little."

As I thought. The seal I put on the LIOH system was lifted.

"The Leo...wait, you mentioned this thing before, it's like the GEIM system, isn't it?"

Yes and no. Its a derivative the Shadow Mirrors developed, intended to be much safer and less damaging to the pilot, by using natural methods, such as injecting stimulants and activating the adrenal glands, to hieghten the pilots combat performance, rather than manipulating their mind directly. The standard GEIM system wouldn't work on you anyway.

"And you shut it off? Why?"

Because the first time it activated, in Mexico, you almost overloaded the Raioh's Plasma Convertor. The system couldn't handle you, Katina. It's meant to augment an average pilots aggressiveness to level you hit naturally. The feedback it got from you almost destroyed the Raioh.

"But then, after you left me in China, the Machine Cells reactivated it..."

Katina, I can control the Machine Cells, but not at a a distance. So long as you're within a few kilometers of me, the system should be safe. But if I'm not there, using the Raioh is too dangerous, and it wasn't exactly safe to begin with.

No, I've been careful not to expose you, and programmed the Cell not to interact with organic material unless specifically ordered to. Your anti-psychodriver abilities are too pronounced, I wouldn't risk exposing you to them even if I was the kind of callous and ruthless being who'd try to control you.

"Keep buttering yourself up, turkey."

Hey!...No, you should be clean of Machine Cells, and I intend to keep it that way.

"Good...any more luck with the real Cells?"

A little, but we need to properly experiment with the Zehirut Crystal first, and the deployment of the Svartalf and Valkyria units is taking up Sophias time.

"The what-whiches?"

The Machine Cell units based on the Gespensts and Lions we've salvaged. They're being assigned pilots now from the DC crews. They're another thing I'd like to keep my eye on, if I can.

Even with the new post limit, we're nearing autosage, so I'm going to pull together a new thread soon.

How soon is 'soon' will be debatable, since I'm going to be quite busy over the next few days. Updates are going to be sporadic at best, I'm afraid.

At least we know the Raioh's kind of safe.

...Kind of.

Well, it's not like it can get any worse, right? I mean, it totally couldn't turn the Einst into Jetzt if they captured it. Or any of our other... machine celled....

......We're fucked.

Aw, c'mon, cheer up, everyone. Let's design a giant robot, it'll make us feel better. I'm presently against keeping Raioh for two reasons. One, it's extremely dangerous to use if we're separated from Dumi. And two, well, it's someone else's mech. I feel like our Katina's the star here, and thus really deserves her own mech made just for her.

I'm in the middle of the designing process, but what would people like to see in a mech made for Katina? What kinds of weapons, super or real, any particulars to the appearance, and so on?

Given how we've been having Katina fight I think it's pretty clear we need a Super that can take a lot of punishment. Would be good to have some weapon that we can use to parry blades and some shit (totally not thinking of our next fight with ALfimi here), maybe some claws like the Vysaga has?

I considered a ribbon-sword for this, though that might be better for a weapon to give to Lamia.

One thing I'm considering is that we tend to milk a lot of use out of using the Plasma Leaders in nonstandard ways, particularly for grabbing things remotely. If we want to keep that utility, but move away from being completely lightning-based, what about having force manipulators in the palms which can grab, pull, and push objects in a similar manner? Repel Alfimi's blades, then draw her in for a Rider Kick.

Pseudo cells+R-Blade+ scrap.

Pseudocells give us some durability, R-blade gives us a suitable melee ability, the scrap gives us more metal and maybe some additional weapons. Comes out looking similar to the R-Blade Custom (pictured)

Maybe armed with greater blade tonfas (or sabers), anti-TK field or G-Territory, maybe slash rippers, the beam cannons on the shoulder would be appropriate ranged weapons for one such as Katina, so less need of a rifle. Tesla Drive for flight of course.

I imagine the anti-tk field as something that disrupts nearby Tk forces, like making T-link rippers, Strike shields lose control or reducing T-link Knuckle to a punch. Effective if we plan to fight the SRW team here, but less useful against the Einst. Alternatively A g-territory would be effective against most ranged attacks and it has precedents in other mechs the R-blades size.

Thought it was so we could get away from the LIOH system that makes piloting the Raioh so dangerous.

Alternatively we could probably procure a Earthgain/Vairose series from one of our allies.

Not a bad start...my biggest complaint with that, though, is that still means we're just piloting a custom of someone else's signature mech, not our own.

What elements from Valsione would people like to see in the final design?

Oh and whether or not we actually have Katina pilot this, we should still machine cell the R-Blade into a R-Blade Custom so that sir Brooklyn of Luckfield has a more suitably awesome mech.

Hmm well the human features for one. Maybe the Psycho Blaster can be combined with the plasma leaders so if anything isn't quite in range, the leaders will drag them into it? Or maybe a Cross-Smasher shotgun blast?

Admittedly I haven't really thought this much on the subject as I never really cared/knew about Raioh much aside from Jinrai.

I figured that would be ideal for Irm's mech - we've gotten the Assault Lander, that ought to provide a good starting frame.

For Katina, I'm considering our needs in capabilities, then our aesthetic preferences. First off, we're a super robot pilot, full stop. We need something powerful and durable that can take the kind of punishment we're likely to both give and receive. We want something with utility, that can do the unorthodox tricks we prefer in most of our fights. It should have the kind of all-around god tier stats appropriate to the main character, and basically be an absolute terror on the battlefield.

So, fighting style.
-Do we like the kick-heavy style of Raioh, or do we want something more hand-focused?
-Do we want to use weapons besides limbs, yes or no?
-Force manipulation, yea or nay? Is there something else you'd like us to be able to do?
-Any other random mechanical choices you think would be useful, or just cool?
