# Episode 05

##SRWQ Mission 5: This fabulous prize could have been yours.

You are the Katina Tarask of the Shadow Mirror Universe. The School taught you how to fly robots and wear frilly dresses. Reducing a grown man to tears with a paperclip, a bottle of shampoo and a roll of sellotape is something you learned for yourself.

The Shadow Mirrors have all but been destroyed by unknown but very familiar invaders from the dimension they planned to invade themselves. In your escape, you managed to capture one: Arado Balanga, a young man who should be dead.

Having brutalized Arado's testicles to get him ready for interrogation, you back off and let Irm and Kai, the two people who think they're in charge, have their say.

"Oh god... oh god, just keep her away from me."

"I'll try my best." reassures Irm shakily. "Now, explain why you attacked us."

"It wasn't an attack!!! We were just... we had to come! The *Cracks,* they were tearing everything apart!! Nothing was making sense anymore... although not as bad as here!!!"

"Slow down son." chimes in Kai. "If you weren't attacking, why are your pals sitting in our base, next to the corpses of half of our forces?"

"I dunno! Gilliam said something about a... a thingummy wave, as we were crossing, that the two forces were on the same path. I, I guess must have crashed into them headlong, or something. It was an accident! We weren't exactly trained for this!"

"What are the *Cracks?"*

This is the quietest thing you've said all day. This only makes it more pronounced. Irm shivers a little.

"....It was a few months ago. We'd just fought off a big palooka, someone called Dark Brain, massive guy from another dimension. We thought we'd seen the last of him, but then, the Cracks started happening.

"Stuff just started... to change. It would disappear, and something similar but different would be there in its place. The New York crater disappeared, and in its place was a big dome with a different city inside, deserted except for tomato plants. A whole colony disappeared, and in its place was a gigantic laser cannon, crewed by a bunch of German guys who thought they were 'New-types'. We found a floating island full of weird monster-robots, and a giant red spear at the South Pole.

"Then, Ring... Mao Industries just vanished. All the people. There were 20,000 satellites, a hundred drone mecha that defended the place, and a massive microwave generator to power them... but not a single person."

You replace your knee in Arado's groin. It feels like theres still something left to squish.

"What the hell kind of bullshit is this?!?!? Start making sense or I'll never have your child!!"

The room suddenly grows extremely quiet, except for Arado' anguished gasp of pain. Even Latooni looks up from what she's doing.

"Er, I mean, 'you'll never have children'. Freudian slip."

"It... it didn't make sense. That was... the point, we had no... idea what was happening, until the Giest appeared."

Kai pulls you away from Arado's testicles and looks into the boys face. "What's a Giest?"

"XN-Giest, a robot that travels dimensions... we destroyed it, blew it to dust, but then it appeared again. Gilliam didn't want to use it, but we had to know..."

"Know what?"

"Dark Brain wasn't dead. We'd killed the him that could exist in our world, but he still existed in all the others. He was... throwing bits of other dimensions at ours, taking our world apart piece by piece, using a channel that was left in our dimension...by you."

Irm looks shocked at this. "By us?! What the hell did we do to your dimens... Oh, you mean Lygues??"

"Yeah! That's the L-word-one! Lygeus and Acguy-Arse! Your dimensional travel devices gives Dark Brain what he needs to attack us!

"But...we never actually used Lygeus!! You guys came and blew it up!!!"

"Exactly!! We used the Giest to travel in time to before you made the jump, and stop you, so the channel never exists! Then we can use the Giest, which Gill modified to make no channel, to get back, hopefully without getting lost in time as we go. I've had enough copies of us these past hours, I don't want to meet myself too"

"...Liar."

"Ugh..."

"YOU'RE A LIAR!! JUST LIKE YOU WHERE AT THE SCHOOL!! YOU SAID YOU'D ALWAY BE MINE, AND THEN YOU FORGOT ME LIKE I WAS DIRT ON YOUR SHOE!!"

"She's got a knife!!"

"Stop her!!"

"AND THEN YOU COME BACK AND YOU FEED ME THIS SHIT?!?!?"

"ARGH!! MY FACE!!!"

"Grab her arms!!!"

"YOU TREAT ME LIKE A BABY!! LIKE A BABY WHO BELIEVES IN FAIRY STORIES!! WELL I WON'T TAke iiiiittt...."

Kai releases his grip from your neck as you slide into unconsciousness.

Irm blinks. "I... I thought that only worked in Star Trek."

Kai grunts. "So did I. Maybe she's a Trekkie."

---

"...locking the door enough?? Shouldn't we have handcuffed her too?"

"We're lucky we had one pair of handcuffs on this glorified schoolbus. Don't the worst she can do in there is kill herself, and that's no great tra-"

"I'M STILL BLEEDING HERE!!"

"...Let's just go."

You've woken up in the port side toilet of the Tausendfuessler. The door has been locked from the outside somehow, and the inside handle is on the ground beside the door. You've been checked for weapons, you only have your hairpins, a hairbrush, a mobile phone with no credit and a melted chocolate bar you apparently left in your back pocket. There is half a roll of toiler paper, a relatively clean toilet brush, and a discarded porno magazine. The light fixture is broken, but light streams in through a small window.

"BUHUHUHUHUomnomnomWAAAAAAOmnomsniffsniff...."

Ibis's voice sounds from outside. "What are you doing in there?"

"I'm eating the chocolate because I'm saa-ha-ha-haad..."

"Wait, you have chocolate?"

"I ate it all but I didn't eat it good and its all over my face and my dress and everythiiiing...."

"...oh."

"If you open the door, I'll let you lick it off."

"....NO!!"

Just then, your mobile begins to ring. DO YOU ANSWER IT??

"Who is this, and why are you calling now, and I WANT TO BE LET OUT OF HERE!!!"

*Dumi, I wanted to know what was going on with you, and alright.*

Suddenly, something is blocking the light from the porthole.

---

Russel desperately banks the shuttle to the left, shouting. "The Trilobite's out of control! It's going hit us!!!"

Rio barely manages to hold onto a hydraulic cable as Ryoto goes head over heels. "Its that damned AI! It really has gone crazy!!!"

There is a horrendous screeching sound, and Ibis dives out of the way as metal fingers crash through the wall of the Tausendfuesslers hangar. There is a final tortured squeal as steel snaps like overstretched gum, and then only the sound of the howling wind blowing past the Tausendfuessler.

The port side toilet is gone.

####MISSION OVER

####FUCKED UP MASTERY EARNED.

---

####SPECIAL INTERMISSION.

######Meanwhile...

"You don't need to drag us all this way, Mr Almer. We...we can sort something out."

"Captain Enfield. For the last time. SHUT. UP."

The Shadow Mirror troopers patrolled the bridge, as Lefina, Sean, and the rest of the crew sat at their stations, dumbfounded by how badly this last mission had gone already.

"Well, at least, you don't have to lock up Lamia like that."

"What I do with that doll is my own business! Besides, your little 'Dimensional co-existence wave' seems to have damaged the original W17. We might need yours for spare parts."

Lefina held her breath to keep herself calm. Aliens, rampant computers, interdimensional overlords...She'd forgotten how terrible a simple human being could be.

"You've hurt us, you Irregulars. Hurt us bad, worse than the EFA, even. And I for one intent to make you repay that debt. This ship is just the downpayment, all those fancy mechs of your will be ours. Your fighters will replace the men and women you slaughtered!!! And you'll break the EFA for us. Maybe then, you can go back to your shithole dimension."

"M-m-mister Axel..."

Axel turned to the bridge operator Eun. "What the hell is it now?? Are those three friends of your still tailing us?"

"N-no, its not Vilett... There are signals ahead of us. Our sensors indicate them as EFA-"

"SHIT!! On the Screen."

The white lines of the Shirogane Kai, the EFA experimental Carrier, were unmistakable to Axel. "It's Linjun's oversized dildo...the ATX have overtaken us. So much for the finest ship in your world!" Eun shrinks away as Axel backhands her.

"You troops! Watch them like hawks. Don't so much as let them look at their weapon controls, our troops will win this. We'll run this blockade, and finally stomp ATX and Beowulf into the dirt!!"

######Another Elsewhere:

"And theeeeere we go."

Shaking off the last of the clay and dust, the Kurogane levels off, and comes to a halt floating above TLI.

"Tetsuya, glad you could make it." calls Irm, the Grungust striding over towards the space cruiser "There was quite a fight up here, we could have used you."

Tetsuya Onodera adjusts his captains jacket, still ill-fitting even after months. "Well, you can blame Gilliam and his fancy gadget for popping us out down there. If we're supposed to be taking on an entire planet, the least he could do was make us all land on the same spot."

"...I'm afraid our running into the oncoming Shadow Mirrors has gotten us a little more separated than a bit of digging."

"What? More of the group are missing."

"The Hiryu Kai fell out of the stream early. Viletta, Leona, Lamia and Mai were still inside at the time. Latooni and Shine didn't materialise. Ryuune materialized, then faded out again."

"What about Masaki??"

"...."

"Ah right."

"Gilliam calculates they all should be somewhere on the planet, but where exactly is hard to narrow down. On top of that, Bullet and Kusuha seem to have been kidnapped by Vindel, and Arado....ran into some familiar faces."

"Well, we were going to have to search the planet anyway, I suppose."

"You didn't happen to find anything while you were down there, did you?"

"None of our lost lambs, that's for sure. It's very obvious that it was the chamber where the Dynamic General Guardians were stored in our world, but whatever was stored in there in this one, was taken without any indication of what was down there."

"Damn. Another super robot or two could have been handy."

"We did find one thing though. As we were drilling, we found a false wall in the concrete. Inside, we found an Aerogater Fatman unit, rusting away."

"Huh? But Lamia said the Aerogaters had never shown up in this world."

"I known. Interesting, isn't it?"

---

The Same Elsewhere, but a few hundred meters away:

"Nothing."

Ratsel raises an eyebrow at Gilliam's remark. "Nothing from any of them? That seems perplexing."

"Brian Midcrid. Graien Grassman. Even Nibhal Mubhal. I've tried every major politician in the Federation committee of our world, as well as a dozen high-ranking military officers. I can't get in contact with any of them. There's no contact office for the Federation Committee, and all Government radio frequencies are scrambled. The EFA of this world has hidden its face from us."

Ratsel grimaces. "So we're on our own..."

"If we're not already marked as enemies. We did do some damage to that EFA unit."

"We can't give up. We have to eliminate all possibilities for where Vindel could be hiding. We'll have to get onto the heads of the mecha industr-"

"I tried Mao and Isurugi. I was put on hold."

"You're not going to let me have a good idea today, are you?"

Gilliam flicked some hair out of his face and rested his chin on his hands. "We're going to have to face the fact that none of our usual support mechanisms exist here. Prejudice isn't going to help us here: With the fate of our entire universe at stake, being prideful could be fatal."

"...You think we should join up with our old enemies."

"You're the perfect man for putting things together under the table. Go to the DC with Sanger, see what you can do. Even the slightest scrap of information could be vital. I'll do what I can to root out the different factions of the Shadow Mirror. The rest of the team will have to organize into search parties, and start covering ground as best we can, to find Vindel and our lost comrades."

"Right. I'll ride faster than the wind, and cook you up a gourmet of intel. Good luck, Gilliam."

"And you, Ratsel. Oh, and keep a particular eye out for signs of the Hiryu Kai, and Viletta."

"Viletta? Why her?"

"She may know some people..."

```
Gilliam hasn't been in SM-verse verse in years. Remember, he arrived in OGverse long enough ago to one of the Aggressors. Things have changed. Also, to clarify (because one of my big problems as a writer is setting a scene), that exchange is taking place in Gilliams old office in SM-TLI. Most of the people he knew from SM-verse were there, and now they've dissappeared into the Endless Frontier thanks to that big interdimensional pileup.

But my point is, Gilliam HAS tried everyone he knows. Either they're out of contact or they're on the other side of the EFAs wall of silence. He plans to find out which.

Man, this Elsewhere's getting pretty boring:

"I don't believe a word of it!"

Ryusei gulps. "No, really! It was another you!! And she was going crazy, screaming at Arado about hell and ghosts and stuff!!"

Katina sniffs. "Doesn't sound like me at all."

"Well, I'm not saying she was exactly the same..."

"You're delusional. You've gotten it into your head that theres another version of everyone on this world, and that we're going to meet them all, one by one, and have silly little adventures where we learned about ourselves and shit. Bunch of comicbook bullshit, that's what it is."

"Can we stop arguing about this and get after them??", pleads Seolla. "I don't want to let that idiot alone with...her, for too long."

Katina whips around and twists her face into a familiar mask of rage. "Are you accusing me of chasing after your bigmouth emptyheaded little shit of a boyfriend??!?! What kind of cradle robber do you take me for?? I'd sooner marry Russel than chase after Arado's bony ass!!"

Ryusei looks at Russel sympathetically. "Ouch."

Russel simply sighs. "Who else is in this group of kidnappers?"

Ryusei brightens up as the subject swings back in his favor, completely forgetting the verbal catfight erupting nearby. "Oh, there was Mirror Ibis, and someone in a Grungust who I'm guessing was Irm, and there was an Evil Latooni!! Maybe if we can capture her, we can use her to find the real Latooni, with, I dunno quantum resonance or something."

"That's it?"

Ryusei muses for a moment. "I think so. There was some random soldier with an Irish accent, thats about it."

"Huh. Well, we'd better..."

"...just because the only thing you've had between your legs in years is the throttle lever on your Gespenst!!"

"OH!! That is IT!! I'm gonna tear off your fake tits and spank your ass off with them!!!"

Russel and Ryusei look at each other in dread, and move to break things up.
