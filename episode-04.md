# Episode 04

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

####SRWQ Mission 4: Gonna keep doin' it till the fapfic ruins it

You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask, an ex-student of the School and wearer of frilly dresses. You are equally as angry as your OG counterpart, but you concentrate your anger into even more murderous bursts of rage and manage to be slightly moe at other times.

The Shadow Mirrors were just about to invade the OGverse when something wierd happened and the OGverse decided to invade you. You managed to escape their first attack, but when retrieving a super robot prototype from another Shadow Mirror unit, you were intercepted by some familiar faces...

Things are becoming less and less canon and the plot is thickening faster than /m/s penis in the presence of Valsione. It's time for part 4 of Super Robot Wars Quest!

Your lineup:

You in the freshly acquired Dynamic General Guardian 03 Raioh. You had an R-Blade but it couldn't stand up to the abuse you were putting on it.

Irm Kazahara in the test-type non-transforming version of the Gust Lander. Theoretically the squad leader, but you seem to have been deciding where you all go, mainly because he cannot resist your moe-face.

Latooni Subota: Queen Bitch of the School, Subota has joined the Shadow Mirror for reasons unknown. She's rather critical of your general lack of self-preservation skill and you're rather critical of the fact you haven't have sex with her yet. Currently trying to restart a heavily damaged Randgrith.

Someone redhead called Douglas whose first name you keep forgetting to ask for. Gun-nut in the extreme. Fighting the R-1 in a red Gespenst she claims belongs to a friend of hers.

Russel Bagman: An irishman, although he's usually sober so that might be an elaborate cover story. Recruiter for the Shadow Mirror and tough brawler of a pilot. His Gespenst has been literally disarmed by the R-1, and the Wildfalken has a gun aimed at him.

Doomy-Chan, the Dynamic Ultimate Something Something, an AI which is operated the DGG unit 4. Its a wierd super robot with wheels on its shoulders, apparently meant to support your new mech.

Your current enemies:

The Loud Dramatic Guy in the Transforming Mech: Apparently wants this all to end peacefully with you talking to them and making sense of all this. His mech is eerily reminiscent of the R-Blade, is white and blue and armed with revolvers. You're not sure how you tear the arms off Gespensts with revolvers, but you're eager to learn.

Arado Balanga in some wierd Melee PT: You killed the Shadow Mirror Arado 2 months ago in a fit of madness when he revealed that no, he wasn't saving himself for future marraige/harem duty for you. This one from another dimension is a lot less willing to suck up to you, and is a deadly melee fighter in his custom mech. He's already trashed 2 of your units and humiliated you. You're torn on whether to kill him or make him your special slave.

Seolla Schweitzer in a sniper PT: You recognise her voice as the mousy girl from the School who spent most of her time doing crochet. This one seems louder though. Her mech has been badly damaged, but it still has an arm and a very large gun, pointed at Russel.

WHAT WILL YOUR NEW ASS-KICKING RAIOH DO FIRST?

---

"I...I..."

*Is something the matter?* asks Dumi, as you stand there in your new unit.

"I...I can't decide which one to kill first!"

*Ah. That may be an issue.*

"No-ones going to be killing anyone!" shouts Mister Dramatic. "This fight is pointless, we're not here to just kill people, we're-" He is cut off as he narrowly dodges M95 fire from Ibis.

"You hurt Sleigh's Gespy-Chan!! You have no right to talk about peace!!"

This new fight snaps you to attention. "Doomy! Save Russell, I have unfinished business!" The Raioh boosts forward, straight at your foe from beyond the grave.

"Jacket Armor, Cast Off!!"

An explosion of shrapnel flies in your face as the ragged remains of the Wuerger's outer armor burst off. Arado bursts into the air, going nearly twice as fast as before. It takes you a second to recover, then you burst into the sky after him.

Meanwhile, Seolla grits her teeth, and pulls the trigger, but, appearing in a flash, the DGG-04 interposes itself between her and Russel, and catchs the energy beam on the wheel-shield on his shoulder. Russel boosts backwards towards the two transports, as Dumi boosts forward.

"Urgh!! What is this thing, it's way too fast for its size??" Seolla desperately dives out of the way, but Dumi is on her in moments.

*I don't think I should be discussing my design philosophy with you. Ridol Slasher.*

Twin blades emerge from Dumi's forearms and cut the Oxtongue rifle into three pieces. Seolla goes for her beam saber, but that too is bisected, and the final blow goes through the Wildfalken's head, crushing the head vulcans.

"YAAA!!!"

*Don't worry, I don't intend to kill you. Dumi points up. I'll leave that decision up to her.*

---

"Dammit, you're just as stubborn as the real Katina!!"

"What are you talking about? I am real! I'M REAL YOU FUCKHEAD!!!"

The Wuerger and the Raioh dance across the sky, the massive super trying to connect with its strengthened legs, and the custom PT trying to get close enough to strike without being crushed. At full mobility, Arado manages to get some strikes in with his sword, but the blows fail to do real damage to the armored behemoth.

"YOU'RE A GNAT!! A BUTTERFLY!! I'LL SQUISH YOU AND PUT YOU IN A BOOK!!"

"Who thought putting this crazy woman in such a big robot was a good idea??"

Seeing a chance, Arado dives in and slices the Raioh deeply just above the right eye, but the Camera just about remains on. You reach out to grab him, but he's way too fast...until you recall the arm weapons.

"Plasma Leader!!"

Energy crackles around the Wuerger as a cage of lightning is formed around it. Arado has just enough time to gasp as he is roughly yanked back into your clutches.

"This is what happens to those who defy me. Counter Break!!"

The Wuergers right leg is sheared off as your kick crushes most of the lower torso. Arado yells as he goes flipping end over end, heading towards the ground.

Meanwhile, Ibis stands dumbfounded over a pile of broken weapons, as the Transforming Mech snaps the last of her Gespensts armament and head at Irm. The Assault Lander pumps out shot after shot, but the mech just doesn't get hit: It's like the pilot knows where the shells are going to go.

"I'll end this madness once and for all!! T-Link Knuckle!!!!"

300 tons of Assault Lander is roughly launched into the air by a mech less than a sixth of its wieght, and comes down on its top. It would seem that this mech is even more impressive than it first appeared, since its able to give the laws of physics the finger.

---

"Right, now for you Dai....Dai...Damn, I can't remember any of the evil Riders names...Dai-Crazy!"

"I think not! Plasma Leader!!"

"N-not agaaiiin!" Arado squeals as you once again pull him into your clutches. Grabbing his mech, you wrap the comparitively tiny mech in a bear hug.

"Don't come any closer, Mr. Hero, or I'll give Mr Flopsy a big hug, I'll squeeze him to my chest until the cotton comes out."

"...There are worse ways to die, but I'd rather you didn't." quips Arado.

The Transformer flies level with you, sizing you up. "You're making a mistake, Mirror Katina. We planned to do this as peacefully as possible, but if you hurt Arado, so help me, I'll...I'll..."

"It's ok, Mr. Loud. You just leave us alone and I'll take....special care of Arado-kun."

"...I don't like the way the way she said that."

"Arado, don't you even think of going with that crazy hussy!! If you do I'll never forgive you!"

"I..I don't have a whole lot of choice in the matter, Seolla..."

"You...you're actually going to go with her. You cheat! You wannabe cassanova!! I'll-"

"Snip it crochet girl! So, Big Damned Hero, what's it going to be??"

"...Dammit." The mech transforms to plane mode, and turns back towards TLI. "Seolla, we can't save Arado like this. We'll have to regroup!"

"I'm not leaving him with the likes of her!"

"We'll be back as soon as we can. Mark my words, Shadow Mirrors, this isn't over!!"

The R-wing flies off, with the Falken managing some wobbly flight after it.

OBTAINED:
1 WILD WUERGER
1 ARADO-KUN

WHAT IS YOUR NEXT MOVE?

You helpfully turn Irm's Assault Lander back over while Latooni and Ibis coax Arado out of his cockpit, and Dumi picks up Russels arms and the other bits and pieces strewn across the battlefield.

"Right team, we can't stay here any longer!" Irm says as he reverses the Lander back into the Tausendfuessler. Katina, get youself and your new computer buddy into the Tribolite, we're taking off. Now."

You sigh. "Alright. Subota, you take good care of Arado-kun for me, I want him fresh for later..."

The conflicted look on Arado's face is priceless.

Dumi's body twists into a motorcycle shape and rolls into the Trilobite, followed by you. The young mechanic, still smarting from where you kicked him in the jaw when tossing him out of the Raioh's cockpit, straps you in as the doors close. Theres a rumble, and the two ships lift off.

Ryoto Hikawa (That's what the tag on his overalls call him anyway) comes over to you as you exit the Raioh, still rubbing his jaw. "What...what did you do that for?!?!"

"You were in my way, I just got you out of the way."

"I was in the DGG-03's cockpit!! I was going through the warmup sequence when you forced the hatch open, dragged me out of the seat and kicked me onto the gantry. I could have fallen and broken my neck."

"...As I said, you were in my way."

A low chuckle comes from the side of the mech-bay, as this studly-looking gentleman walks up to you. "If you can be forced out of a mech so easily, boy, its no wonder you're a grease monkey and not a proper pilot."

You go goggle-eyed. "You! You're Kai Kitamura!!"

"Observant young lady, aren't you?"

"You're the federations top ace!! Ex-Aggressor and head of the Cry Wolves!! What are you doing on a Shadow Mirror ship?"

Kai taps his eyepatch. "Things got a little...complicated. Now, maybe you'd like to tell me exactly how deep in shit we are right now?"

Ryoto turns at him aghast. "N-no! We're still under orders from Colonel Mauser to keep you secure. You're still not cleared as a true Shadow Mirror!"

Kai smirks at this. "I think the lady can decide what she says and does without a grease monkey parroting orders at her. Or do you think you can stop her?"

Ryoto looks at you, and gulps.

You slap Ryoto across the face. "Go away boy, adults are talking."

Now clutching both cheeks due to the pain, Ryoto backs off, then runs towards the cockpit.

You turn back towards Kai, but now that you're alone with the living legend, you're feeling sort of intimidated. You absentmindedly twiddle one of the ribbons on your dress as you talk to him.

"W-well, I'm not certain of all the details, but...the portal thing, which we were going to escape into, mechs starting coming out of it while we were getting ready to go in. Powerful mechs, and some of them had School pilots, except they're different versions of who're de...who can't be in mechs like that. There's more than one of more than one person, if you know what I mean."

"...Copies, from another world."

"Yeah! That's what they were saying, that they've come here to....do something."

"Something?"

"I....(sweatdrop) I'm not very good at catching details in the middle of a battle."

Kai rubs his jaw completatively. "Well, the two of us aren't going to work this out alone. Let's have a chat with the other ship, see were we stand."

"Well, are you coming?"

"...Ki-Kitamura-sama..."

"Yes?"

"C-c-can I have your au-au-autograph?"

"Heh-heh. Wish I could, Miss, but the grease-monkey was careful not to leave pens or paper around a suspected spy."

"Well, you.....youcouldjustcutmeandthenIdahaveascartorememberyouby!"

Kai is absolutely expressionless for 8 seconds.

"...I don't cut girls on the first date."

On the bridge, Ryoto is sitting in the corner nursing his wounds, while a chinese-looking girl with 'R. Mei Long' on her flight jacket is fiddling with the main computer.

"No! Stupid AI, I'm the pilot! You can't just take control from me, you're not even supposed to be operational!"

*I'm merely trying to releive you of a pointless task, so you can undertake matters of greater concern. We require technicians far more than pilots right now, the Tausendfuesslers mech complement is severaly damaged and needs repair.*

"But...but you're a computer!! What if you bluescreen, or get a virus, or go crazy and decide to destroy humanity?"

*Rio, I understand what you're saying, but Ibis is crying.*

"...What?"

You pinch Rio to get her out of the way, and grab two headsets from the comms unit, tossing one to Kai.

"You can chat to Irm, he thinks he's in charge. I have to see what this all about."

Dumi helpfully patches you through to Ibis' Gespenst, and sure enough you hear the sniffs of someone trying to compose themselves.

"I...Ibis isn't it? What's the matter?"

"...*sniff*...Damn you, Sleigh..."

"That's your friend, isn't it? What about her?"

"She...she's run off again, on another crazy tangent, without a word! Just a stupid message, hidden in the OS of her mech. 'I have been chosen.' She said the same thing when she ran off to the DC, and again when she went to Shadow Mirror. What does that even mean? Why does she do this to me? We're practically family, why can't she stay in one place? *sniff* I just want us to go back home together..."

~~skip [^1]~~

Anyway:

IBIS RELATIONSHIP LEVEL UP
GAINED SKILL: KNOWLEDGE (IBIS'S BACKSTORY) (Which I'll bring up when relevant)

You dry your eyes and turn to Kai.

"I've been on to Lt. Kazahara, and I think I have a better understanding of what's going on now."

SUMMARY

Your Pilots:

Yourself
Kai ('Well, assuming Lt. Kazahara lets me onto a mech')
Irm ('Sounds like he's fairly green, to be honest')
Russel ('He's piloting the Tausendfuessler though, so he might not be available')
Ibis ('Assuming you ladies are done with your little session')
Latooni ('She's guarding the prisoner')
Dumi ('A little odd, but if it works, it works')

Engineers
Johnathan Kazahara
Rio Mei Long
Ryoto Hikawa ('Microchips is right, you're needed over there on the Tausendfeussler')

Prisoners
Arado Balanga ('We need to have a proper chat with this kid...')

"Yeah-heh-heh....er, yeah, a chat. With words. And whips. I mean, completely professional interrogation tools."

"...We should go as a group to see him."

Mech Status:

Tausendfuessler: OK
Trilobite: OK
Rai-oh: Minor damage, mainly superficial.
DGG-04: Undamaged
R-Blade: There aren't enough parts of the two arms left to replace them both. If you cannabilised one, you might be able to fix the other.
Blue Gespenst: You could reattach the arms, but they wouldn't work at full capacity until they were properly overhauled. The chances of them jamming at a critical moment are high.
Red Gespenst: Pretty much intact, but the paintjob is fucked. The plasma stakes are offline, but there are spare weapons on the Tausendfuessler to rearm it.
Randgrith: With a few hours work, you can reattach the Linear Bazooka and adjust it so it can fire weapons without falling over. But the torso needs an overhaul, otherwise any majot hit could collapse the superstructure
Assault Lander: Mostly intact, although the mark of the R-1s fist is one dent that you'd need more than a hammer to get out of the bodywork. Ammo at 60%, but you can steal some from the Randgrith in an emergency.
Wilewuerger: The bottom half of the torso is almost completely gone: Theres no way to reattach the right leg, and the left wouldn't take than much persuasion to pop right off. The Tesla Drive is intact thought, so it can fly, but the missing limbs mean its majorly off-balance, so you couldn't rely on it in combat. The Jacket Armor theoretically could be snapped straight back on, but you've torn it to shreds, so theres little point.

REPAIR PRIORITIES PLEASE.

Finally:

PLANS AND OPINIONS

"Irm managed to get through to the remaining Shadow Mirror forces. This is the map of what the current outlay is."

"Axel is in command of a unit in the north. They've secured a transport of some kind, but more importantly, they've managed to capture one of these new pilots and thier machine. To the east we have another, larger group of survivors, led by something called 'Unit W'. Niether Irm nor Axel would explain what that meant, so I assume its some kind of big secret. They had to veer east to avoid enemy reinforcements, putting them further away from us and on the other side of an enemy formation.

"Northwest of us should be the remnants of the EFA assault force, uncluding ATX and Beowulf. I don't need to tell you that going that way is a bad idea."

"...You kinda just did."

"Quiet. Now, the only other non-EFA stronghold on the continent is the Neo-DC's California stronghold. It's a mud fort in the middle of nowhere that the EFA won't even bother attacking, but its the only thing within reasonable distance. The only other option would be to go looking for a rebel group in South America or the Caribbeans, or run the Gauntlet past Langley Base to head for the ELF in Europe.

"We all need to discuss this, and quickly."

The others:

Johnathan: "We can't do anything like this. Either we head to California, or we turn around and surrender ourselves to the newcomers."

Irm: "I...I think we should give the kid back his mech and send him back to his friends, otherwise they'll chase us down again, and I don't think we can handle another assault."

Kai: "We're keeping the kid: We need all the intel we can get. Top speed to California Base, at least we can make a stand there."

Axel: "I'm heading to California, even if I have to cut my way through Beowulf to get there. This doll WILL tell me whats going on!"

Unit W Commander: "We do not have usable forces to break through the enemy lines: We will have to head south."

Russel: "I'd rather we not dangle our willies in front of the dogs anymore."

Ibis: "California has weapons, right?"

Latooni: "The optimal conservative strategy is to retreat to California, regardless of our other forces. However, the enemy forces are arrayed so we could make a rear assault on their southern lines and link up with our other unit. It's a risky strategy, but potentially fruitful."

Rio: "California. Definitely."

Ryoto: "....Who let all these crazy people into the Shadow Mirror?"

Arado: "Please! Lets just go back to my friends! They'll explain everything!!"

---

The ELF is the Earth Liberation Front, an anti-EFA resistance group, one of the largest of the many such groups due to being funded by both the Shadow Mirror and other sources. It was essentially the Shadow Mirrors military wing until the EFA broke them in an major campaign 3 months ago. After this, Shadow Mirror was forced to disband its other puppet groups in order to form its own military froces, and begin its escape plan.

Katina was in the ELF before she transferred out to TLI. There is still a lot of local support in parts of europe for the ELF, but the vast majority of their forces are either dead or were part of the SM forces that just got decimated.

You have no idea if anyone made it. About 90% of SM forces made it into the portal before it turned red. Then about a third of them were vomited back out, mostly in pieces. You're not even slightly qualified to guess what could have happened to the other 60%, and neither is anyone else here. [^2]

Japan is practically a fortress for the EFA, its the base of Project SRX, and the security over that is obscene: It's better protected than the EFA goverment.

---

Kai twitches his mustache. "I was sort of being completist there, I don't actually know of any groups in the are-"

"ELF Brasilia branch, deep cover money laundering and hiding of equipment and personnel. Previously used for smuggling people and materials via Africa, before the EFA occupied the DC's underground base near Dakar."

Latooni adjusts her glasses.

"I know some people there."

---

Anyway. Armaments.

The R-Blades tonfas

The 2 Gespensts between them have 1 M95 MG, 2 M13 Shotguns and 1 Mega Beam Rifle. There are Split Missiles and Plasma Cutters to spare in the TausendFeussler, but no replacement Slash Rippers.

The Randgriths weapons are mainly fixed other than its knife, although you could move the Spider Nets to another unit.

The Wuerger's Cold Metal Sword is available.

And the DGG-04 has some sort of transformable weapons called Ridols, but only it can change them between modes.

---

Johnathan on our Repair Prospects:

Redspenst: "It's fine, just a few cannon hits. I'll have it shipshape in an hour or so. I don't think I have time to repaint it though."

A-Lander: "It's not in any danger, but I would like to give it a lookover. It's at about 80% right now, I can make that 90% in two hours."

Randgrith: "I'll need 3 or 4 hours to get it safe to walk around in and reattach everything. As for being-combat ready..."

> Can we cannibalize anything to stabilize the Randgrith?

"It's not a matter of parts, the frame itself is buckled. The Armor plates are out of alignment, the hydraulics have turned to spaghetti, and if it one or two more spars were to be removed, the chest will collapse in on itself. It'll still 'work', its the risk of getting hit that's the issues. The Randgrith isn't the most mobile of units."

>Install the Wurger's Tesla Drive into the Assault Lander to increase its mobility.

"No offense, Miss, but simple maths: Thats a 4G Tesla drive meant for a 50-60 ton mech, the A-Lander weighs 313 tons empty. The only thing the drive'll do is make it bounce more when it hits a pothole."

>Cannibalize R-Blade

You suggest the idea of taking the legs of the R-Blade and using them to fix the Wuerger.

"Actually, from what I can see, those units are using very similar frames, some kind of upgraded Gespenst frame....Yeah, it should work, it won't be an exact match but it'll do the job.
"It'd take a while though. There's not a lot of room in the 'fuessler for that kind of job. If I was to do it on the way to California, we'd be finished just about by the time we'd arrive, and that leaving the 'Grith and Gespenst in the lurch."

"Could we give the Spider Nets to the Assault Lander?"

"Eh, sorry, the A-Lander doesn't have conventional hardpoints to attach them to. We were going to attach some in the production model, but this is just the Test Type."

"The blue Gespenst, I'd say 2 hours to fix the arms back on, 4 if you want me to add new servos. And even with that, you're looking at 70, 80% mobility without a full overhaul."

---

The team decides quickly: Head to California, meeting up with Axel en-route. A message is sent to Unit W to head south into Mexico, and to secure transport to Brasilia if they can. They acknowledge.

Rio and Ryoto transfer to the Fuessler and get to work on the Bluepenst, while John fixes the Redpenst with help from Ibis.

Now comes the big moment:

"Is it...safe, to let her near the prisoner?" whispers Irm to Kai.

"Probably not, but its safer than not letting her near him."

"Urk...good point."

The three of you enter the Tausendfuessler's isolation room, where Arado is handcuffed to a wall bracket, with Latooni in the corner, a pistol in one hand and her I-tablet in the other.

"He's been trying to convince me I'm his best friend and we're practically brother and sister, even though I met him maybe 5 times at The School."

"Irm! Kai! You're like the real versions, aren't you? You'll listen, right? You....you're not like HER, right? Oh god, please don't be like her?"

WHAT IS THE FIRST QUESTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK ARADO? OR WILL YOU LET IRM AND KAI ASK THE QUESTIONS? OR WOULD YOU RATHER DO SOMETHING ELSE?

Irm winces as you attempt to turn Arado's testicles to mash potato with your Knee. Latooni shakes her head and tries to ignore you. Kai watched impassively.

"Arado Balanga is dead!! Where did you come from??? DID YOU COME FROM HELL???"

"AAAARGH!! STOP, PLEASE!!! I'm from the other universe, the other one. Irm! Kai! Save me from her! AHHHH!!!"

Kai still just watches. Irm, however, looks like he's about to say or do something.

CHANGE TACTICS? NEXT QUESTION? STAGE 2?

[^1]: I'm going to skip over the tearful consolation segment, because I have a penis and thus don't understand such things very well.

[^2]: Out-of-character, recall in OG2, when the jump went perfectly, not all of them made it either, and their arrivals were scattered over a period of 6 months or so. Also, I'm not even pretending that this is operating on any guiding principle except the rule of cool
