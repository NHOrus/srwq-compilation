# Episode 40

##SRWQ Mission 40: Quite possibly the big one

In our last episode, Katina and Arado made fuck. Also, Vindel and Lemon started abusing the False Machine Cells, then managed to unite the different factions of the DC together into an alliance against the EFA, which Ryuune promptly sold out to the OG protagonists. Now, taking a short break from the fuck-making, Katina and Arado plan with Duminass on where they should go from here...

---

Arado sits naked in your bed, watching as you pace back and forth in front of the viewscreen with Dumis eye in it. You count off on your fingers as you go through the points.

"Right, so right now, we have three options. Option 1 is to wait and see what happens, and try to give Dumi and Sophia time to fix the Machine Cell problem."

*Not really feasible in the current climate, I fear. Science is unpredicatable, science involving psychically-activated self-reproducing alien crystals doubly so. And trying to make a breakthrough during what could be the final battle for your planet would be virtually impossible.*

"...Right. The second is, starting a coup. Round up everyone who's unhappy with Vindel and Lemon, get them ready and once we're in the right position, see them and their cronies off and seize control of Shadow Mirror, and call off this alliance thing with the SRX bastards."

*More doable, but I doubt it'd end well. The rank and file are more likely to rally behind the charismatic Vindel, we don't have any such figurehead. Axel's current condition makes him a poor choice, and-*

"Wait, something happened to Axel? You said he was fine!"

*I said he was physically fine, the beatdown he recieved from the SRX caused him a rather harsh bout of amnesia. He was the highest-ranking Shadow Mirror behind our two problems, and now he can barely remember his name. That's not a good quality in a leader. Can you think of any alternatives?*

"Not in Shadow Mirror, anyway. I was thinking of nominating me, but I've realised I'm not as popular as I thought."

*We would have to delegate to another faction, like Ryuunes DC or your old pals in the ELF. It'd likely cause more schisms than it solved. And we wouldn't have much of a fighting force to face the First and the SRX afterwards.*

"Which leaves option 3: Cut and run."

Arado frowns. "Run where? And with who? You're not thinking of splitting us up again, are you?"

"No! Lat and Seolla will come with us, and whoever else we can get. We could try just leaving and wandering about, but we'd get chased down by all our enemies. So, we might have to go with Dumi's idea..."

Arado looks at the Diamond Eye. "Which is?"

*Leave this dimension. Travel to another world, away from the mess that's been made here. Away from the dimensional storm that's been kicked up. Try to... I don't know, find a new home? Get jobs? See the sights of the frontier? We'll figure it out once we're safe from all the ruckus we've kicked up.*

Arado is shocked. "You can do that?! Just up sticks and leave the whole universe behind?!"

*...I have the capability. I would need your help to do some unfinished business, but once we handle that, the group can transition with minimal preperation.*

You turn to the young man. "Well, Arado, what do you think?"

"...I'm not sure. Theres a part of me filled with bile and hate, wants to stay here and tear new holes for all the assholes who made the School. There's a part of me who wants to do the noble thing, save the world from the aliens and rebuild things after. And theres this black cloud in the middle of my head that says, fuck it, I don't care about this world anymore, let's just go. I... honestly can't choose. But Kat... whichever way you go, I'm not going without the others. It might be a family of psychos, but its still my family."

*I have a bias for leaving, but I'll support you if you decide to stay, Katina.*

"Maybe we'll come back later, once we've fixed ourselves up and have a better chance of doing something right. I dunno. But staying here means getting sacrificed to feed Vindel and Date's bullshit fake war, and I'm not willing to stand for that. We go."

Arado nods, then grabs for his overalls. Dumi's eye simply blinks. *Who will be accompanying us, aside from you two, the two you mentioned, Sophia and my three pals?*

Arado seals up his suit. "I'll talk to Seolla, you get Lat. Whoever else you want, we can split between us."

Lefina looks up as Despinis opens the hangar door. "Cap... Marion, where you expecting me?"

"Something like that." Despinis looks odd, almost like there are emotions on her face. "Out corroborating the info Dumi sent to you?"

"As much as the Shadow Mirrors and DC are willing to talk to me... Yes, it seems you two are tellign the truth. Even ghastlier than I imagined..."

"Why did you join the EFA, Lefina?"

Lefina looks puzzled at this. "Well I... I wanted to see space, I guess. To sail among the stars, to see new worlds, maybe even new civilisations..."

"And not to act as a grunt in the power-plays of inhuman overlords. Or human ones, for that matter."

"..."

"Lefina, you came with me because you were unhappy with the EFA, but I don't think someone like you would be any happier working for Vindel Mauser and his thugs. I think you'd be happier in those new worlds, meeting those new people, away from the slime of this planet that would only use you as a weapon."

Lefina looks shocked: Despinis is almost impassioned as she speaks. "Marion... what exactly are you offering here?"

"Your dream, Lefina. And so much more besides..."

---

"Why are you still here?"

Bet Barshem swings her helmeted head around to face you. "I have been ordered to liase with the Shadow Mirrors, Ms Tarask, to help fulfill the Balmarian need for a new home. That task is unlikely to change in the near future."

"...Yeah it is. In 8 hours Vindel will be signing us up with Project SRX, the most anti-alien faction on the whole planet, even more than the DC. Or did he leave that part out when he explained that to you?"

"...It's possible. So you are saying that your leader doesn't share your preference for peace between our peoples?"

You shrug. "Frankly, I'd say Vindel just doesn't give a shit. Maybe he thinks that after the First are gone, he'll need another alien threat to scare people into making war, so he's keeping you around for that."

"Thats... worrying. Ms Tarask... Are you planning to do something about this?"

"Yeah. I'm gathering up everyone with a proper head on their shoulders, and I'm blowin' this popsicle stand. And I think you should come with, if only to escape the chopping block later."

Bet Barhsem nods. "I understand. If you can give me a short amount of time, I may be able to help you..."

---

Laodicea frowns. "Bet Barshem, once again, you give me annoying news that proves I'm taking the right course."

The hyperwave hologram bows slightly. "As you ordered me to, commander."

"And yet you say than the Duminass Entity and its allies will be attempting a coup in the near future?"

"The warrior Tarask described it as a breakaway. I don't think they desire power, merely independence."

"Regardless, this is our oppurtunity. Their main dissident faction, the leaders of the anti-alien group, and the local Zuvorg representative: Targets to tempting to ignore. If we crush them now, we can focus on the two factions in the planetary government, and gain the leverage we need for the new Balmar nation."

Beside Laodicea, Baran Doban steps forward. "Commander, I'm ready to go! With the true warriors of the Shadow Mirror fighting with us, we can easily overwhelm them, and sieze our future in our hands!"

"Very well." Laodicea flourishes out his hand. "For the good of the Balmar Empire, and for the Humans as well, I order you to mobilise!"

---

"Master, you got that, right??"

*Yes, Tis, I did. It seems things are going more smoothly than I thought.*

"What? But... Master, people are going to die! People I know! We can't just let them-"

"You're still calling Dumi 'Master', Tis, after all this time?"

"Despinis, don't start..."

"The Balmarians actions only appear contrary to ours on the surface, but in reality, this is exactly what we need. Am I not correct, Dumi?"

*Indeed, Despinis. Katina... needs to break the chains she holds to this place. They're almost all gone, but this should be the final stroke. All we have to do is... not tell her.*

---

MEANWHILE, WHILE THAT WAS GOING ON:

*Leaving the alien woman to her own devices, you finally find the two you're looking for: Axel and Lamia.*

"Axel, I... have a proposition for you."

"Oh, hey, I don't think we've been introduced. I'm Axel Almer. Nice dress."

"Oh thank you, I'm Katina Tarask." You moe-face hard. "Axel, have you really considered whether or not you want to stay here with the Shadow Mirror?"

"...Nope, haven't had time, Lamias too busy showing me random crap."

"Axel, I have to jog your memory somehow!"

You raise an eyebrow at the android. "Come on now Lamia, do you really want to do that?"

Lamia pauses, her face conflicted. Axel jumps in ahead of her.

"But wait, are you saying you want to take me somewhere? Is that a come-on?"

"....Not yet. No Axel, I just think...you're too good of a guy to waste sitting around here. You deserve to go somewhere...interesting."

Lamia looks really concerned now. "Wh-why would you drag Axel away from here? This...The Shadow Mirrors, their fight...It's his whole life! His entire existence is wrapped up in these people, their missions, the mech in that hangar....That isn't gone, is it?"

Axel scratches his head. "...I really don't get all this stuff you keep saying about me. This guy you keep talking about seems way too serious to be me."

"Axel, you..." Lamia screwed up her eyes and her fists. "You told me...That a real person couldn't turn away from the Shadow Mirror's battle. That if we gave up, then we'd end up with a world of dolls, dancing to the tune of the pupper masters. That even if every Shadow Mirror but you and me were dead, we'd still have to fight together. Was that...Was that all just...bullshit?"

Axel twists his lips as if he's embarressed by his ignorance. "I...I guess its ok advice...if the EFA is that bad...But it still sounds way too heavy to have come from me. I may be 7 years older then I remember, but you'd have to be, like 90 to say something like that with a straight face."

Lamia sags as Axel turns back to you. "So, where would we be going again?"

Lamia's easy. We point out that it's her decision to make. If she wants to continue living and being a tool for Vindel, no matter what happens she'll be a doll in his eyes.

We, on the other hand, are more than willing to let her decide if she should go or not. Yes, it's reverse psychology. But it works.

ELSEWHERE

The guard doesn't even look up as Arado swipes the keycard and enters Seolla cell. The boy finds her sitting on the stool she had been tied to, crocheting. He notices she's managed to repair her clothes with the results, which seems rather impressive.

"...Where did you get the wool? And the needles?"

"Needles were in the seam of my dress. Latooni didn't even pat me down when she captured me. I made a substitute for wool from the fibers of the blanket I was using. Not very good. It itches"

"Seolla, that...That officially goes beyond a hobby at this point, and into a primary skillset. You should give up as a sniper and do, like, crochet in gold thread for kings and shit."

"The EFA has disbanded all remaining monarchies except Riksent over a century ago, and Riksent is gone. There are no kings."

"...Seolla, I want you to come with us. We're...leaving the Shadow Mirror, we have no purpose here. Let's start over, somewhere else, somewhere were not even the School can find us. Let's have a life, Seolla."

Seolla sets down the needles. "...N-no..."

"Seolla, you can't seriously-"

"I MADE OATHS!!" She throws the crochet into the corner as she jumps out of the seat and onto the bed. Cowering against the wall, she whispers hoarsely. "I made...a solemn promise...to fight with her..."

"Ouka..."

"Th....The Silver Squire. The Black Knight and the Silver Squire. She....she even made me a mask to go with hers....but I couldn't put it on, everyone would...would look at me. But I...I will keep my promise. For Glory, For Honor, To Raise the Blade and Strike the Stars..."

She begins to repeat the mantra, rocking back and forth against the wall. Arado merely turns, and clenches his fists. "Ouka, what did you do to her? And, when we meet...what are you going to do to me?"

Right, I was going to suggest just taking her with us no matter what and then get her to agree after the fact but that would probably do more harm than good. Problem is short of kidnapping Ouka and taking her with us I can't see an immediately obvious way around this.

You cough in an incredibly fake fashion to gain Latoonis attention. She doesn't even look up from the Rapiecages new cockpit controls.

"So, Subota...I guess you'd be looking forward to the upcoming fight then..."

"A severely reduced Shadow Mirror force, allied with disparate and badly mauled factions of the DC, and entering into a forced alliance with highly powerful EFA forces who are all but guaranteed to destroy us the moment we become less useful to them, against the combined might of the EFA military and an alien force with powerful biotechnology on a PT scale, multiple ace human pilot enhanced to near-immortality, and any number of unknown forces of either nature. And with the addition of extradimensional forces with power of an entire faction concentrated into a few dozen mechs, and another alien force overhead with unknown goals and priorities.....It's an interesting tactical conundrum."

"Yeah? I think I can do better."

"Pray tell."

"Other dimensions, Subota."

Latooni looks up.

"So you've finally cracked the whole way. You're going to let that oversized leprous brain take you to the leprous brain pit that spawned it. You're going to go looking for the dark places in the universe, to see what depths you can plunge into."

"Something like that...You're interested, aren't you?"

"It's...intruiging. And that is a cute strategy, Tarask, weighing the infinite unknown against the situation here, finite, known, but horribly lethal....But no. You haven't done enough work."

"Huh?"

"Show, don't tell, Tarask. Prove to me that your side trip will be worth my time, that I'll get more out of applying my skill to that other world than to this one. If you can do that, I'll consider your generous offer."

You dejectedly enter the canteen, finding Kai nursing a coffee while Rand and Kar-Wai talk at him in an obvious attempt at cheering him up.

"You can't let yourself beat yourself up, Kai!" Kar-Wai pats the mustached man on the back. "You know you're not responsible for how they turned out, and it was you who rescued them, wasn't it? Every commander loses soldiers..."

"Yeah...Did I mention Hawker was dead? Got into the DC in a big way, ended up kamikazing his Killer Whale into the Shirogane at the battle of Aidoneous Island."

"...That's a low blow, Kai."

"Yeah, well, replace this coffee with some proper drink and I'll consider being more honorable in our little pep-duel."

No, but we can make it work. I've suggested a few things to say towards convincing Seolla and Latooni. Also point out that what Latooni is trying isn't a risk, it's suicide. There's no way that the Einst are unaware of the SRX's existance. The fact that they didn't have the program shut down is proof that they don't even consider it a threat. The SRX nearly destroyed us. We have no chance here. Risk your life if you want, but at least risk it where you have a chance to gain something, don't just go seeking death!

Oh gods, that's an explanation for Latooni's behavior. Latooni is trying to commit suicide...

"I snuck out through the air vents. And I changed clothes to disguise myself."

"...From a red frilly dress to a purple frilly dress."

"It's working isn't it?"

"Only because everyone with the inclination to put you back in your box is too busy with the final prep for the assault. Now, you asked about my joining the Mirrors?"

"Yeah! It can't be worth what Vindel is doing with the Pro-"

"Katina, I joined the Shadow Mirrors fully expecting to have to suck Vindel off nightly in order to get what I wanted. His coming back doesn't magically change things. In fact, this alliance massively moves things forward. It gets the SRX and the First and Only onto a war footing, and forces them to reveal their hands. Which is exactly what I wanted. Now why would I want to back away from all that before its done? That'd be pretty heelish of me, to help set things and motion and then just sitting back to let so many others die for my beliefs? Least I can do is fight with them, Katina."

Is Sophia around? Ask her if she wants to come with you and find a place to finish the Machine Cells for what they were intended to be, instead of helping Vindel with his plans to use them to spread war and destruction. This way, we have Wodan on our side.

Convince Latooni that the machine cells will be bad news for her. How exactly can she test her skills if most of the performance she'll be using is an unfinished product, let alone something that everybody has? She won't be a risk to be remembered, only another name in the roster of Vindel's army of people who won using the machine cells.

Honestly, I don't think there's any hope for Seolla, though. We might have to convince Arado that we need to leave her behind.

You see Hugo walking tentatively through the aisle of the medical ward on his new legs, while a new girl you assume is Aqua stares out at him from under what can only be described as a tent made out of pillows and blankets. You're tempted to talk to them now, but you have to make one final attempt. You have to fix this.

"Jayce? Jayce, it's me, Katina. You remember, the beautiful young woman who kicked your ass at Goldeneye?"

The man sits in the chair beside Rings bed, head down, staring a hole in the floor. His only response is "How..."

"Huh?"

"He means, 'How can you be so trivial?'. "How can you think of something so petty?' 'How can you forget her?'" Rings flexes her gloved right hand and looks angrily at the man in the chair. "Are you just going to keep repeating yourself, Jayce?"

"I'm...sorry. But monkey think, monkey do, I guess. It keeps repeating, so do I. That one moment..."

Ring looks crestfallen again. "Jayce, I.."

Jayce looks up. His skin isn't marked like Arados was, but both his eyes are now silver-grey, and seem to have an unnatural light. "Couldn't you have...or...Maybe..." He looks down at the floor again.

You also sheepishly look at your shoes. "I...I'm so sorry, Ring. I didn't mean for it turn out like this...I really thought I was fixing him! I didn't know this was what the cells would do."

Ring raises her hand, somewhat unsteadily but with renewed emphasis now that she can make the gesture again. "Katina, responibility lies with me. I made the desicion. I made it rashly and without proper planning, and I accept the consequences for it. You blaming yourself won't he-"

"I remember you making the same goddamn speech at the inquiry after the accident. Now who's repeating themselves?"

You both look at Jayce, who's on the edge of the chair.

Jayce curses at himself. "...Dammit...This isn't...It isn't me..."

You draw yourself up to full hieght. "We'll both help you, Jayce. We'll see to it you're back to your proper self in no time."

"Mina would never accept a whiner like this....motherfucker, I'm doing it again..." He flops down again, staring at the floor once more.

You lean in closer to Ring's bed to whisper at her. "Ring, Dumi knows a way to fix this, but we can't do it here, with the Shadow Mirrors. We've gotten a small group together, and we're going to get out of here. If you come with us..."

Ring nods. "I'll meet up you as soon as I can get them to discharge me. I'll need to talk to Shuu, he's the reason I've stuck it out this long. But, so long as you can keep the Huckebien with us, I'll drag Jayce to Pluto and back to get him fixed."

"It...could be further than that."

The Eurydices meeting room is small, and the sizable crowd has filled it to the brim. Radha's retreat to the next room definitely helps the rest gain breathing room.

"J-just remember, I'm only going back to India! I'm not going on any crazy trip to another world! I'll get off in Calcutta, and that will be fine for me, really."

Tytti Norbach shrugs. "Your loss. I don't intend to pass up this sort of chance."

Kar-Wai frowns. "Don't you have family you need to see again? You've been missing for years, Tytti, they'll want to see you."

"My father is dead. My bitch of a mother won't have shed two tears over me. All that's left in Finland for me is a couple of needy ex-boyfriends and my senile uncle who keeps trying to make me get a job in his sweet factory. I don't see how any of that can compare to seeing a new world."

"I...guess I didn't think of it quite like that."

"What about you, Kar-Wai? Do you have a family keeping you here?"

"...I have the Aggressors." He scratches at his implants again. "I think I've accepted that I'm not going to have a normal life, not like this, but my comrades...I don't think I could live with myself if I abandoned them. I'm sorry, Tytti. I don't want an adventure. I want to make up for the battles I've missed while I was Galuin. I want to make up letting my friends end up as they did. I appreciate the sentiment, of starting over fresh...but I've got too many ghosts to make that work."

We can't do this alone. What do we have now? Hugo and Aqua, who are both suffering from Einst induced Trauma. Arado. Dumi and the Homunculi. I THINK Lefina and Bet Barshem. Maybe Axel, maybe Lamia, maybe Kar-Wai, maybe Latooni. It's not enough. We have, as of now, and including ourself, 4 mentally unstable people, a cosmic horror who is suffering from an attack of scruples and its children, and a relatively clueless ship captain. We probably will get Sophia and Wodan, but we have reason to be worried there, too, given Sophia could go Magus.

At your end of the table, Arado buries his face in his hands. "Seolla won't go. Not without Ouka. We need to find Ouka and get her to come with us, or..."

The pause goes on too long. You sigh, as much at Kar-Wai leaving as at Arado's mood. "Subota wants...proof of some kind, that wherever we end up going will be 'worth her time'. I don't know about that girl, I'm starting to think she's trying to find the most elaborate possible method to commit suicide."

Latooni's motivations are complex, but at least she doesn't seem opposed to the idea per se. Perhaps changing the apparent future of this world will change her mind, rather than trying to change it directly.

Bet Barshem frowns under her helmet, which she still hasn't removed. "You seem to have a lot of unsure people, Ms Tarask. Are these people even going to follow you, or did they just show up for the caffiene-brew?"

Axel shrugs. "I'm in all the way on this. How can I say no when there are all these pretty women going?"

Lamia looks dejected on the seat behind him. "Yeah, I'm going."

Lefina salutes unconsciously. "I'm going for definite!"

Lenonjayce and Ring have pledged to come, but they're currently stuck in the medical bay of Trilobite 1, along with Hugo and Aqua. Getting them out of there by conventional means would require a lot of cajoling and disregard for proper medical procedure. And, with only three hours to the SRX deadline, it may take too long.

Bet Barshem waves her hand in an odd gesture, which seems to suggest 'Don't worry.' "My people are willing to help cover your escape. We have enough drones that we can easily distract the Shadow Mirrors long enough for you to make an escape."

If we want to get away before the deadline, we will need this level of support. The process of retrieving all those people, on top of the Huckebien's core and the Raioh, will require force. There are simply no ways around it, we'll essentially have to force the ground crews to place them aboard, while under fire most likely.

"A grim prospect."

There is something to be said for a wait-and-see attitude. It would allow for the patients to be let out of the medical bay naturally. It would give us a chance to manipulate events so our desired mechs are placed aboard the Eurydice or a similar accessible location. And it would allow us to fine Russel, Ibis and possibly this Black Knight, assuming the SRX faction hold up their end. However, it creates the possibility that the SRX will trap us, and use us like ammunition against the First and Only. And other events could potentially threaten us.

KATINA ULTIMATE DECISION TIME: Choose your strategy for getting the characters and mechs that you want when you leave.

The Eurydice can carry 6 mechs, and so can Dumi's Transport form. Super Robots count as three, remember that. If Dumi is in transport form, he can still use beams and his forcefield, but it's not optimal compared to, say, him becoming a dragon.

The Eurydice currently holds the 4 Ezekiels, The Granzon, and the Gespenst Type S/Alien Construction/T-Link System, or the SALIENT for short.

Bet Barshem is promising Balmar drone support for any strategy you adopt.
