My busy period is over, Updates will continue but may still be a bit sporadic.

In our last thread, Katina and Arado made fuck. Also, Vindel and Lemon started abusing the False Machine Cells, then managed to unite the different factions of the DC together into an alliance against the EFA, which Ryuune promptly sold out to the OG protagonists. Now, taking a short break from the fuck-making, Katina and Arado plan with Duminass on where they should go from here...

Arado sits naked in your bed, watching as you pace back and forth in front of the viewscreen with Dumis eye in it. You count off on your fingers as you go through the points.

"Right, so right now, we have three options. Option 1 is to wait and see what happens, and try to give Dumi and Sophia time to fix the Machine Cell problem."

Not really feasible in the current climate, I fear. Science is unpredicatable, science involving psychically-activated self-reproducing alien crystals doubly so. And trying to make a breakthrough during what could be the final battle for your planet would be virtually impossible.

"...Right. The second is, starting a coup. Round up everyone who's unhappy with Vindel and Lemon, get them ready and once we're in the right position, see them and their cronies off and seize control of Shadow Mirror, and call off this alliance thing with the SRX bastards."

More doable, but I doubt it'd end well. The rank and file are more likely to rally behind the charismatic Vindel, we don't have any such figurehead. Axel's current condition makes him a poor choice, and-

"Wait, something happened to Axel? You said he was fine!"

I said he was physically fine, the beatdown he recieved from the SRX caused him a rather harsh bout of amnesia. He was the highest-ranking Shadow Mirror behind our two problems, and now he can barely remember his name. That's not a good quality in a leader. Can you think of any alternatives?

"Not in Shadow Mirror, anyway. I was thinking of nominating me, but I've realised I'm not as popular as I thought."

We would have to delegate to another faction, like Ryuunes DC or your old pals in the ELF. It'd likely cause more schisms than it solved. And we wouldn't have much of a fighting force to face the First and the SRX afterwards.

"Which leaves option 3: Cut and run."

Arado frowns. "Run where? And with who? You're not thinking of splitting us up again, are you?"

"No! Lat and Seolla will come with us, and whoever else we can get. We could try just leaving and wandering about, but we'd get chased down by all our enemies. So, we might have to go with Dumi's idea..."

Arado looks at the Diamond Eye. "Which is?"

Leave this dimension. Travel to another world, away from the mess that's been made here. Away from the dimensional storm that's been kicked up. Try to...I don't know, find a new home? Get jobs? See the sights of the frontier? We'll figure it out once we're safe from all the ruckus we've kicked up.

Arado is shocked. "You can do that?! Just up sticks and leave the whole universe behind?!"

....I have the capability. I would need your help to do some unfinished business, but once we handle that, the group can transition with minimal preperation.

You turn to the young man. "Well, Arado, what do you think?"

"...I'm not sure. Theres a part of me filled with bile and hate, wants to stay here and tear new holes for all the assholes who made the School. There's a part of me who wants to do the noble thing, save the world from the aliens and rebuild things after. And theres this black cloud in the middle of my head that says, fuck it, I don't care about this world anymore, let's just go. I...honestly can't choose. But Kat...whichever way you go, I'm not going without the others. It might be a family of psychos, but its still my family."

I have a bias for leaving, but I'll support you if you decide to stay, Katina.

WHAT WILL KATINAS INITIAL PLAN BE?

So I'm all for ditching this joint with the other Schoolies.

Given the current situation, I'm inclined to think that if we leave, things will be far, far worse off if and when we ever come back. We can't really trust anyone beyond Kai, Kar-Wai, Ring, or Irm to have a plan to move in the right direction as of now.

But, given that our hands are pretty much completely tied, cutting and running is the best option. At the very least, every one of our friends are (mostly) intact as of now, so we wouldn't be losing much. We'd better have a contingency plan if we do want to return in the future however, especially with Vindel in charge again.

I suggest before leaving, stop by Lune's to try and build some sort of safehouse power base for if and when we do return, since she seems to be the most consistently trustworthy of the major players. Try and convince her to offer asylum to the former Agressors and Sophia when the Meteor-3 of shit that's coming hits the giant, Neviim-size fan hanging over the planet right now.

Most of the Aggressors seem to have too much invested in this world to come with us, unfortunately, as does Sophia and her entourage.

Given his current mental state, however, Axel may be easily convinced. And if he comes along, Lamia stands a good chance of following as well. If he recovers mid-jaunt, we may have problems however.

It's possible, depending on what happens between them from here on out. I'm hopeful for Axel/Lamia to happen, but he still has far too much baggage attached to his former life for me to remain entirely convinced yet.

I'm all for bringing him along, but we should still be careful that he doesn't suddenly regain his memory at a bad time.

"Maybe we'll come back later, once we've fixed ourselves up and have a better chance of doing something right. I dunno. But staying here means getting sacrificed to feed Vindel and Date's bullshit fake war, and I'm not willing to stand for that. We go."

Arado nods, then grabs for his overalls. Dumi's eye simply blinks. Who will be accompanying us, aside from you two, the two you mentioned, Sophia and my three pals?

Arado seals up his suit. "I'll talk to Seolla, you get Lat. Whoever else you want, we can split between us."

WHO DOES KATINA WANT TO MAKE THE OFFER TO? And who do we talk to first?

Rough-and-ready Dramatic Personae (May have missed a few, remind me if I did).

Irm and Johnathan Kazahara
Axel and Lamia
Bullet
Kusuha
Giado, Garnet and their baby
Kai, Kar-Wai, Rand, Hugo and Aqua

Note that some will be willing to leave Shadow Mirror with you even if they wouldn't want to leave this dimension. Also, if you want to discuss anything else with someone, this would be the time to do so.

Recall that Russel and Ibis will not be in a position to answer you unless you find the Kurogane.

None of these options are good. If we cut and run, then there probably won't be anything left for us to save when we get back. I don't like just abandoning everyone to save our own skins. The other two options have the problems Dumi enumerated.

Can we try to just leave the Shadow Mirrors and join up with say, the Irregulars? Don't cut and run from the world, just from Vindel and his stupid plans?

Honestly, I think it might be prudent to convince Vindel and Lemon that this is a good idea.

After all, if the School children go then they're all out of sight when the SM joins up with Yukiko, and I'm not sure she'd be too happy with the knowledge that we're all with Shadow-Mirror. Axel should come since in his current state he's practically useless, same with Lamia (in Lemons eyes at least...the bitch.). Sophia needs time to work on the True Cells, so she's in as well.

Just attach a half-decent diplomat/leader to this crew (possibly Irm?) and you've got a somewhat reliable away team.

I'm still wary of going dimension hopping right now. I think we should try the coup idea. It's not the easy way but I think we have a chance if we wait for the fighting to go on for awhile. Most likely Vindel will start losing support when the Shadow Mirror start taking the brunt from the attacks so that may be our chance to stage the coup.

Plus I think up and leaving might leave the world in a worse condition when we return.

Talk to Axel and Lamia first. They have nothing left to lose right now, really.

After that, head down the list of people we trust, starting with the Aggressor group (Kai, Kar-Wai, Ring, Rand, Hugo, Aqua). Setsuko and Toby seem trustworthy, but we haven't spent all that much time with them yet. Radha and Tytti come with free Ezekiel experience, but Radha's too much of a load right now.

Bullet could be a powerful ally, and he probably does not agree with Vindel's ideals at all, but he would feel honor-bound to stop him, so he might not want to come with us. The same -may- go for Shuu, but again, he's become far, far less trustworthy as time passed and may have been lying through his teeth at us the entire time.

I suppose that means Wodan is as well.

Extend the offer to Lefina (try to snag the Eurydice as well), Kusuha, Irm & Johnathan, Radha (since she wants to get away from all this conflict), Axel & Lamia, and Ring and Jayce (since he really needs to be kept safe until the true machine cells are produced). A lot of the others I'd love to get to come along with us, but I'm not sure they would be inclined to.

We could always stop over in the OGverse for a time, as unstable as it is. It has already shown a...discrepancy between it and the SMverses times, after all, since it seems that the longer you stay in one the more backwards you go in time in the other. You get the idea anyway.

Maybe theres another universe out there with the same interdimensional properties? Anyway, the point is there's a precedent, which means it IS possible.

We got firepower and a strategy girl...One with danger fetish.

Our scientist problem is solved with sophia...

Now we need diplomat guy...Does anyone of current group knows more than first aid?

Kusuha might be good choice. Plenty of medical expertise and not that bad people person.

I am pretty sure Radha would like a pause from what is happenin around here...Might as well take Tytti with us.

Irm isn't piloting anything important and Jonathan could get time to design Neo Grungust...And Irm has skill ranks in diplomacy, which any of doesn't have..

We could also try take Axel and Lamia for sheer hilarity and take a small revenge against Lemon for being bitch...After all Soulgain is useless and anyone can pilot Angelg...Right?

Irma and Jonathan

Axel and Lemon
Radha and Titty.

Let me put my reasoning here

>Axel and Lamia
>Ring and Jayce

These two pairs are a given, merely due to popularity and general utility.

>Lefina

Having our own battleship is VALUABLE. More to the point, she's not likely to object. Hell, she'd probably come without us asking if Despinis goes.

>Setsuko and Toby

We owe Setsuko a Virgola Glory. Also, I can't condone leaving her comatose aboard a ship that's moving into a war zone.

>Bet Barshem

Bet is our best chance to get the Balmarians back on our side. Not to mention that she hasn't gotten enough screen time.

>And Kai and the ex-aggressors/cry wolves, at the very least Rand, Hugo, and Aqua.

Kai is a leader. He's also capable of being diplomatic and seems like the most trustworthy out of all the leadership around here. Kar-Wai is also a good leader. Rand has the Gunleon, and Hugo and Aqua need to be taken out of this conflict so they can recover.

Seconding this on the GTFO this dimension plan. Also I would like to suggest we see if we could convince Magus/Sophia and Wodan to come simply to fix the machine cells to their full state. Bullet is a bit risky as while he does not agree with Vindel on some things a knights honor is everything.

>Irm and Johnathan Kazahara

We could probably convince Irm to come along, but I don't see the advantage...

>Giado, Garnet and their baby

Garnet and Giado don't belong on the battlefield, and I don't see how they contribute.

>Shuu

Untrustworthy. Plain and simple.

>Radha and Tytti

On the one hand, they'd probably agree to come. On the other, Radha simply has purpose to us. Tytti on the other hand...

Lefina looks puzzled at this. "Well I....I wanted to see space, I guess. To sail among the stars, to see new worlds, maybe even new civilisations..."

"And not to act as a grunt in the power-plays of inhuman overlords. Or human ones, for that matter."

"..."

"Lefina, you came with me because you were unhappy with the EFA, but I don't think someone like you would be any happier working for Vindel Mauser and his thugs. I think you'd be happier in those new worlds, meeting those new people, away from the slime of this planet that would only use you as a weapon."

Lefina looks shocked: Despinis is almost impassioned as she speaks. "Marion...what exactly are you offering here?"

"Your dream, Lefina. And so much more besides..."

"Why are you still here?"

Bet Barshem swings her helmeted head around to face you. "I have been ordered to liase with the Shadow Mirrors, Ms Tarask, to help fulfill the Balmarian need for a new home. That task is unlikely to change in the near future."

"...Yeah it is. In 8 hours Vindel will be signing us up with Project SRX, the most anti-alien faction on the whole planet, even more than the DC. Or did he leave that part out when he explained that to you?"

"...It's possible. So you are saying that your leader doesn't share your preference for peace between our peoples?"

You shrug. "Frankly, I'd say Vindel just doesn't give a shit. Maybe he thinks that after the First are gone, he'll need another alien threat to scare people into making war, so he's keeping you around for that."

"Thats...worrying. Ms Tarask...Are you planning to do something about this?"

"Yeah. I'm gathering up everyone with a proper head on their shoulders, and I'm blowin' this popsicle stand. And I think you should come with, if only to escape the chopping block later."

Laodicea frowns. "Bet Barshem, once again, you give me annoying news that proves I'm taking the right course."

The hyperwave hologram bows slightly. "As you ordered me to, commander."

"And yet you say than the Duminass Entity and its allies will be attempting a coup in the near future?"

"The warrior Tarask described it as a breakaway. I don't think they desire power, merely independence."

"Regardless, this is our oppurtunity. Their main dissident faction, the leaders of the anti-alien group, and the local Zuvorg representative: Targets to tempting to ignore. If we crush them now, we can focus on the two factions in the planetary government, and gain the leverage we need for the new Balmar nation."

Beside Laodicea, Baran Doban steps forward. "Commander, I'm ready to go! With the true warriors of the Shadow Mirror fighting with us, we can easily overwhelm them, and sieze our future in our hands!"

First, you have to hit the damn thing. Which is fucking impossible.

Now, I can't remember if I slapped a barrier on or not in Alpha 3, but if not, on top of godly evasion this thing has a natural barrier that blocks most attacks. So not only would you have to hit it, but it'd have to be with a heavy hitting attack that usually isn't too accurate to start with. And the barrier would absorb most of the damage.

Of course, it's also got HP regen, so if you manage to hit it once and it dodges like five times, it's back to full health again. And all the while, it's shooting black holes and dimension-tearing-lasers at you from a distance.

In short? Stay the fuck away from it. You don't even die if you get hit with it's strongest attack, you fucking cease to exist. That means that even if one of the many religions in this world is right, whatever happens to your soul wouldn't happen because your soul wouldn't even exist. You'd just cease to be.

Ruach planned to harness it at some point during @3, that's all I know. Maybe it was one of the high-end Balmar uints or Keiser Ephes himself. I'd bet the latter, given his nature.

Another fun fact: Ain Soph Ur uses one side of the Triangle of Solomon in its attack. Valzacard's EX Nova Shoot Over uses all three.

The Valzacard is a combination of 2-4 different technologies (I don't recall whether all 3 civilizations in the previous universe had a hand in it's creation). One of these is strongly implied to be the Fury. Yeah, it's stronger. Not to mention that it has several attacks that break space time.

And how many are more than superficial again? Combattler has maybe five attacks you ever -want- to use in an SRW. In-show...it's a monster of the week show. A lot of these old supers have 50+ attacks because they were in monster of the week shows where they needed 50 different ways to kill the monster that was immune to the other 49 at the end of the episode. It's like how Black RX pulled powers out his ass because the episode's plot didn't work if he didn't have them. Notice how newer supers (and that's a relative term, I mean compare 90s to 70s) have less, or have a smaller set of attacks or weapons that are more versatile. Or all the attacks get split up between multiple robots, because that's significantly better for selling toys.

Arguably, the only weapons we need are the Plasma Tonfa (Blades of Chaos with lightning for the tethers). If you insist on lightning, they provide all the utility of the Plasma Leaders while also having the RIP AND TEAR that suits Katina. Anything else added on besides just those is gravy. Plasma Tonfa, eye lasers, and shotguns is a setup that gives us options at range, melee, and in-between, while keeping the number of options reasonable. A -bit- can be added onto that, but not a lot more is necessary simply because the Plasma Tonfas are so fucking versatile.

Personally, I'd say we go with the six-segment blades. If we split it up and link them together with lightning, we get a lightning net. Maybe stick tiny plasma generators in there too? Would be useful.

I disagree. I say it's better to have a reasonable array of equipment that's useful in most situations, with a coherent fighting style, than to stick everything you can think of in "just in case" and end up with something that lacks coherency. We're not fighting alone, remember, we -have- allies. If we need remote weapons for something, Latooni already has them. If we need to snipe something, Seolla's got it covered. Having two extendable blades is reasonable and versatile - having six feels like overkill.

(I've gotta stop being shocked when I leave the thread for a few hours and find over a hundred posts have been made.)

MEANWHILE, WHILE THAT WAS GOING ON:

Leaving the alien woman to her own devices, you finally find the two you're looking for: Axel and Lamia.

"Axel, I...have a proposition for you."

"Oh, hey, I don't think we've been introduced. I'm Axel Almer. Nice dress."

"Oh thank you, I'm Katina Tarask." You moe-face hard. "Axel, have you really considered whether or not you want to stay here with the Shadow Mirror?"

"...Nope, haven't had time, Lamias too busy showing me random crap."

"Axel, I have to jog your memory somehow!"

You raise an eyebrow at the android. "Come on now Lamia, do you really want to do that?"

Lamia pauses, her face conflicted. Axel jumps in ahead of her.

"But wait, are you saying you want to take me somewhere? Is that a come-on?"

"....Not yet. No Axel, I just think...you're too good of a guy to waste sitting around here. You deserve to go somewhere...interesting."

Lamia looks really concerned now. "Wh-why would you drag Axel away from here? This...The Shadow Mirrors, their fight...It's his whole life! His entire existence is wrapped up in these people, their missions, the mech in that hangar....That isn't gone, is it?"

Axel scratches his head. "...I really don't get all this stuff you keep saying about me. This guy you keep talking about seems way too serious to be me."

"Axel, you..." Lamia screwed up her eyes and her fists. "You told me...That a real person couldn't turn away from the Shadow Mirror's battle. That if we gave up, then we'd end up with a world of dolls, dancing to the tune of the pupper masters. That even if every Shadow Mirror but you and me were dead, we'd still have to fight together. Was that...Was that all just...bullshit?"

Axel twists his lips as if he's embarressed by his ignorance. "I...I guess its ok advice...if the EFA is that bad...But it still sounds way too heavy to have come from me. I may be 7 years older then I remember, but you'd have to be, like 90 to say something like that with a straight face."

Lamia sags as Axel turns back to you. "So, where would we be going again?"

Lamia's easy. We point out that it's her decision to make. If she wants to continue living and being a tool for Vindel, no matter what happens she'll be a doll in his eyes.

We, on the other hand, are more than willing to let her decide if she should go or not. Yes, it's reverse psychology. But it works.

ELSEWHERE

The guard doesn't even look up as Arado swipes the keycard and enters Seolla cell. The boy finds her sitting on the stool she had been tied to, crocheting. He notices she's managed to repair her clothes with the results, which seems rather impressive.

"...Where did you get the wool? And the needles?"

"Needles were in the seam of my dress. Latooni didn't even pat me down when she captured me. I made a substitute for wool from the fibers of the blanket I was using. Not very good. It itches"

"Seolla, that...That officially goes beyond a hobby at this point, and into a primary skillset. You should give up as a sniper and do, like, crochet in gold thread for kings and shit."

"The EFA has disbanded all remaining monarchies except Riksent over a century ago, and Riksent is gone. There are no kings."

"...Seolla, I want you to come with us. We're...leaving the Shadow Mirror, we have no purpose here. Let's start over, somewhere else, somewhere were not even the School can find us. Let's have a life, Seolla."

Seolla sets down the needles. "...N-no..."

"Seolla, you can't seriously-"

"I MADE OATHS!!" She throws the crochet into the corner as she jumps out of the seat and onto the bed. Cowering against the wall, she whispers hoarsely. "I made...a solemn promise...to fight with her..."

"Ouka..."

"Th....The Silver Squire. The Black Knight and the Silver Squire. She....she even made me a mask to go with hers....but I couldn't put it on, everyone would...would look at me. But I...I will keep my promise. For Glory, For Honor, To Raise the Blade and Strike the Stars..."

She begins to repeat the mantra, rocking back and forth against the wall. Arado merely turns, and clenches his fists. "Ouka, what did you do to her? And, when we meet...what are you going to do to me?"

You cough in an incredibly fake fashion to gain Latoonis attention. She doesn't even look up from the Rapiecages new cockpit controls.

"So, Subota...I guess you'd be looking forward to the upcoming fight then..."

"A severely reduced Shadow Mirror force, allied with disparate and badly mauled factions of the DC, and entering into a forced alliance with highly powerful EFA forces who are all but guaranteed to destroy us the moment we become less useful to them, against the combined might of the EFA military and an alien force with powerful biotechnology on a PT scale, multiple ace human pilot enhanced to near-immortality, and any number of unknown forces of either nature. And with the addition of extradimensional forces with power of an entire faction concentrated into a few dozen mechs, and another alien force overhead with unknown goals and priorities.....It's an interesting tactical conundrum."

"Yeah? I think I can do better."

"Pray tell."

"Other dimensions, Subota."

Latooni looks up.

"So you've finally cracked the whole way. You're going to let that oversized leprous brain take you to the leprous brain pit that spawned it. You're going to go looking for the dark places in the universe, to see what depths you can plunge into."

"Something like that...You're interested, aren't you?"

"It's...intruiging. And that is a cute strategy, Tarask, weighing the infinite unknown against the situation here, finite, known, but horribly lethal....But no. You haven't done enough work."

Convince Latooni that the machine cells will be bad news for her. How exactly can she test her skills if most of the performance she'll be using is an unfinished product, let alone something that everybody has? She won't be a risk to be remembered, only another name in the roster of Vindel's army of people who won using the machine cells.

You see Hugo walking tentatively through the aisle of the medical ward on his new legs, while a new girl you assume is Aqua stares out at him from under what can only be described as a tent made out of pillows and blankets. You're tempted to talk to them now, but you have to make one final attempt. You have to fix this.

"Jayce? Jayce, it's me, Katina. You remember, the beautiful young woman who kicked your ass at Goldeneye?"

The man sits in the chair beside Rings bed, head down, staring a hole in the floor. His only response is "How..."

"Huh?"

"He means, 'How can you be so trivial?'. "How can you think of something so petty?' 'How can you forget her?'" Rings flexes her gloved right hand and looks angrily at the man in the chair. "Are you just going to keep repeating yourself, Jayce?"

"I'm...sorry. But monkey think, monkey do, I guess. It keeps repeating, so do I. That one moment..."

Ring looks crestfallen again. "Jayce, I.."

Jayce looks up. His skin isn't marked like Arados was, but both his eyes are now silver-grey, and seem to have an unnatural light. "Couldn't you have...or...Maybe..." He looks down at the floor again.

You also sheepishly look at your shoes. "I...I'm so sorry, Ring. I didn't mean for it turn out like this...I really thought I was fixing him! I didn't know this was what the cells would do."

Ring raises her hand, somewhat unsteadily but with renewed emphasis now that she can make the gesture again. "Katina, responibility lies with me. I made the desicion. I made it rashly and without proper planning, and I accept the consequences for it. You blaming yourself won't he-"

"I remember you making the same goddamn speech at the inquiry after the accident. Now who's repeating themselves?"

You both look at Jayce, who's on the edge of the chair.

Jayce curses at himself. "...Dammit...This isn't...It isn't me..."

Jayce shakes his head, and with a visible effort, turns to face Ring. "Ring, shut up about responsibility...You rebuilt the Raubtier Project after the accident...Do the same to me. I don't like this whining any more than you do."

You draw yourself up to full hieght. "We'll both help you, Jayce. We'll see to it you're back to your proper self in no time."

"Mina would never accept a whiner like this....motherfucker, I'm doing it again..." He flops down again, staring at the floor once more.

You lean in closer to Ring's bed to whisper at her. "Ring, Dumi knows a way to fix this, but we can't do it here, with the Shadow Mirrors. We've gotten a small group together, and we're going to get out of here. If you come with us..."

Ring nods. "I'll meet up you as soon as I can get them to discharge me. I'll need to talk to Shuu, he's the reason I've stuck it out this long. But, so long as you can keep the Huckebien with us, I'll drag Jayce to Pluto and back to get him fixed."

"It...could be further than that."

"I don't care. I'm ready to go the minute that nurse with the alcohol breath pulls out the IV."

The Eurydices meeting room is small, and the sizable crowd has filled it to the brim. Radha's retreat to the next room definitely helps the rest gain breathing room.

"J-just remember, I'm only going back to India! I'm not going on any crazy trip to another world! I'll get off in Calcutta, and that will be fine for me, really."

Tytti Norbach shrugs. "Your loss. I don't intend to pass up this sort of chance."

Kar-Wai frowns. "Don't you have family you need to see again? You've been missing for years, Tytti, they'll want to see you."

"My father is dead. My bitch of a mother won't have shed two tears over me. All that's left in Finland for me is a couple of needy ex-boyfriends and my senile uncle who keeps trying to make me get a job in his sweet factory. I don't see how any of that can compare to seeing a new world."

"I...guess I didn't think of it quite like that."

"What about you, Kar-Wai? Do you have a family keeping you here?"

"...I have the Aggressors." He scratches at his implants again. "I think I've accepted that I'm not going to have a normal life, not like this, but my comrades...I don't think I could live with myself if I abandoned them. I'm sorry, Tytti. I don't want an adventure. I want to make up for the battles I've missed while I was Galuin. I want to make up letting my friends end up as they did. I appreciate the sentiment, of starting over fresh...but I've got too many ghosts to make that work."

Tytti shakes her head as Kar-Wai squeezes past Lamia and Radha, and out the door.

Let's at least give everyone who we can trust and who might potentially come along a shot. I.E., everyone listed earlier except Shuu, Manami Hamill, and Lily Junkers.

We can't do this alone. What do we have now? Hugo and Aqua, who are both suffering from Einst induced Trauma. Arado. Dumi and the Homunculi. I THINK Lefina and Bet Barshem. Maybe Axel, maybe Lamia, maybe Kar-Wai, maybe Latooni. It's not enough. We have, as of now, and including ourself, 4 mentally unstable people, a cosmic horror who is suffering from an attack of scruples and its children, and a relatively clueless ship captain. We probably will get Sophia and Wodan, but we have reason to be worried there, too, given Sophia could go Magus. The most stable person we have is Bet Barshem, but she's not exactly going to help matters either. And then we have 4 maybes. We need more than this.

It'll be some semblance of an ultimatum, and provided we don't tell someone who might squeal, we might get a few people to change their minds.

Incidentally, we need someone powered by the False Cells except the emotion they feel is love. That way they can have a combo with Arado and Jayce.

At your end of the table, Arado buries his face in his hands. "Seolla won't go. Not without Ouka. We need to find Ouka and get her to come with us, or..."

The pause goes on too long. You sigh, as much at Kar-Wai leaving as at Arado's mood. "Subota wants...proof of some kind, that wherever we end up going will be 'worth her time'. I don't know about that girl, I'm starting to think she's trying to find the most elaborate possible method to commit suicide."

Latooni's motivations are complex, but at least she doesn't seem opposed to the idea per se. Perhaps changing the apparent future of this world will change her mind, rather than trying to change it directly.

Bet Barshem frowns under her helmet, which she still hasn't removed. "You seem to have a lot of unsure people, Ms Tarask. Are these people even going to follow you, or did they just show up for the caffiene-brew?"

Axel shrugs. "I'm in all the way on this. How can I say no when there are all these pretty women going?"

Lamia looks dejected on the seat behind him. "Yeah, I'm going."

Lefina salutes unconsciously. "I'm going for definite!"

Lenonjayce and Ring have pledged to come, but they're currently stuck in the medical bay of Trilobite 1, along with Hugo and Aqua. Getting them out of there by conventional means would require a lot of cajoling and disregard for proper medical procedure. And, with only three hours to the SRX deadline, it may take too long.

I think we're alright if we can get Latooni and Seolla. Sophia and Wodan are guaranteed according to Dumi. We don't need to take everyone, and in fact only having a small core cast might be advantageous from the perspective of character development. Let's just not go crazy, and we'll be alright.

Bet Barshem waves her hand in an odd gesture, which seems to suggest 'Don't worry.' "My people are willing to help cover your escape. We have enough drones that we can easily distract the Shadow Mirrors long enough for you to make an escape."

If we want to get away before the deadline, we will need this level of support. The process of retrieving all those people, on top of the Huckebien's core and the Raioh, will require force. There are simply no ways around it, we'll essentially have to force the ground crews to place them aboard, while under fire most likely.

"A grim prospect."

There is something to be said for a wait-and-see attitude. It would allow for the patients to be let out of the medical bay naturally. It would give us a chance to manipulate events so our desired mechs are placed aboard the Eurydice or a similar accessible location. And it would allow us to fine Russel, Ibis and possibly this Black Knight, assuming the SRX faction hold up their end. However, it creates the possibility that the SRX will trap us, and use us like ammunition against the First and Only. And other events could potentially threaten us.

KATINA ULTIMATE DECISION TIME: Choose your strategy for getting the characters and mechs that you want when you leave.

The Eurydice can carry 6 mechs, and so can Dumi's Transport form. Super Robots count as three, remember that. If Dumi is in transport form, he can still use beams and his forcefield, but it's not optimal compared to, say, him becoming a dragon.

The Eurydice currently holds the 4 Ezekiels, The Granzon, and the Gespenst Type S/Alien Construction/T-Link System, or the SALIENT for short.

let me get this straight, we know vindel is going to say no, and that we're going to have to immediately attempt a breakout as soon as he does. that said, we still want to throw away the element of surprise by asking him if we have permission to sneak out?

ok, so once vindel has katina summarily executed for this, we're going to need a new main character. i nominate lat.

The problem is that we know that Vindel's kind of insane, but we don't know for sure if it's in a way that he'll go 'fuck you, DIE' or 'Haha that sounds like a perfectly overly complicated scheme GOD SPEED' or even 'well whatever, we've got MACHINE CELLS bro don't even give a fuck'.

"So you want to leave, eh? Sure, why not! And why, I'll just give you all my best aces and mechs while we're at it!"

...

"By the way, I'm not being sarcastic. Also I'm coming too."

...Actually, that's a decent possibility. Go ahead with the original plan...Hmm...

I don't like the idea of telling Vindel at all, to be honest. I don't see how it could end well...

actually, if we explain it to him in the right way, i could see vindel going along with it. basically we would be jumping to OGverse, taking it over while all their most powerful mechs are trapped in our world, producing an army of true machine celled supermechs, then re-invading our own world. just like the original plan, but better. the only problem is that this is a fast track to the evil overlord route.

Also, that's not what we were planning at all, and, you know, it's stupid, given that someone has been dicking around with OG land.

Then we just go somewhere else! Simple.

Also we should probably have Sophia pitch it as her idea, and we just mistook it for something else being, well, who we are.
