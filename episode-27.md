# Episode 27

##SRWQ Mission 27: Why cause problems for yourself when you can cause problems for everybody?
In our last thrilling installment:

Having infiltrated Hellgate, hijacked Professor Juergen's ODE system, and restored our AI partner Dumi to his true Duminass form, our heroine Katina Tarask went about searching the Neviim for captive humans. She found Colonel Kar-Wai, Radha, and Tyutti Norbuck, and had an altercation with Patricia Hackman in an alien-enhanced Gespenst S, who had seen the destruction of Balmar and had sworn to defend the few remaining survivors. With the Neviim defenses assaulting them and the real Balmarians waking up, our heroes fled, to attempt to salvage the situation later.

Now there's a couple of problems to deal with. One is the sphere full of pissed-off aliens. Another is the EFA fleet which is coming to investigate the commotion. Then there's the DC faction whose base you've just lost to the aliens. And finally, there are the rescued humans, who've been lost for years on the floating alien tomb, and have no idea that there's been a DC war, an Inspector war, and that the EFA is run by tentacle monsters now.

---

"Ok, Dumi, what exactly do we have at hand right now?"

*Me. The Judecca unit from the Neviim, although how to pilot it, and whether that would be a good idea, are things I haven't figured out yet. The Eurydice, a Hiryu Mk.II class scout vessel captain by Despinis, who's desperately trying to convince here crew that the EFAs demands for explanations are fake. Despinis' mech, currently hidden behind a false wall in the Eurydice's hangar. The young woman Mai Kobayashi, who's still very disturbed by the whole affair and can't really do much. 287 Bartols, under my command, although Juergens could also operate them. The Peregrine-class ship 'Remember Elpis'. Professor Juergens and a small fraction of the equipment used in his ODE system, currently very unhappy and I keep having to promise him some of my technology to keep him placated. 5 high-mobility Bartol prototypes known as Mirongas, with no ODE system, and DC pilots for them. You and the Raioh. Ms. Hackman and an alien mech built around the frame of the original Gespenst-S. Jennifer Fonda, Radha Byran, Colonel Kar-Wai, Tyutti Norbuck, and 3 alien mechs.*

"Huh. That's a lot to keep track of."

Aidoneus Island

The Kurogane fires again, across the heads of the enemy mechs, as the Irregulars race across the cratered surface of the deserted Island.

"The Signals coming from over here!" Irm launches out a boost knuckle, knocking a Gespenst out of the air.

Kyosuke swings the Alt Eisen around and fires his shoulder Claymores at another squad. "Everyone, we hold here!"

The Rein Wiessritter flutters through the air, exchanging potshots with the EFA carrier approaching the Island. "These boys must really be into me to chase me all across the Pacific!"

Tasuku brings the Giganscudo around in a lumbering arc, soaking up enemy fire. "We're just answering an SOS, and they do an all-out attack! What is with this EFA?"

Kyosuke forced his Revolver Bunker into the drivetrain of another Gespenst, disabling it without killing the pilot. "We already know they have Einst technology, so it possible they can mind-control even their normal troops into suicidal fanatics..."

The ground below them starts to shake, and just next to the Grungust, a hatchway opens up. 

Irm backs away from the new opening. "Whatever brought us here, its coming out."

The bird leaps out first, spitting missiles and lasers as it soars into the air. 4 Lions are in flames before they can even react. And behind it, a red giant, aglow with green light as a chest beam sweeps the ridge.

A mans voice. "RRAAAAGGGHH! For the sake of the Earth!"

A woman. "In the name of justice!!"

Excellen blinks. "Well, this is a pleasant surprise..."

"G-THUNDERGATE!! Salvation from the skies!"

"COMPATIBLE KAISER!!! Vengence for innocent blood!!"

"FIGHTERS ROAR AND EMMY! WE WILL SAVE THIS WORLD, OR DIE TRYING!!!"

Darkest Africa

"And they didn't see you sneak out of the base?" Gilliam looks worriedly into the jungle.

Ryuune shakes her head. "The DC are paranoid, but they're also undermanned, so security was far from unbeatable."

Sanger raises his head. "Did you learn anything more of this Sophia Nate and her machine cells?"

"Nothing. Vat Tran has her holed up in a bunker with Aguija, and hasn't let the Shadow Mirrors even get close to them. He says he'll make this Dimensional Scanner for us, but beyond that, we haven't a clue."

"This scanner is our best lead so far, we can't risk Vat Tran going back on his word. We have to find some way to make Vat Tran trust us."

"Not going to be easy. He's not like the Vat Tran of our world. He's lost to the EFA too many times, he's desperate and paranoid. If we want to sway him, we'd have to give him some primal advantage against the EFA..."

Ratsel sighs. "This world seems intent on dragging us further and further into its conflicts. We may not be able to stay disconnected much longer."

Gilliam nods. "Head on back, Ryuune, and keep us posted. We'll have to stay in the area regardless: If anything happens to that scanner..."

The Black Knight switches off the video feed and flips on her comms. "Director, more Irregulars have arrived at site DC-382. Appeared out of thin air. Theres an entire platoon of PT types, and 3 super robots."

"Understood. Our operation is already underway, the Kurogane will be in your locale within 12 hours. Observe these newcomers, and prepare tactical dossiers for the engagement team. "

"Roger. Black Knight out."

The whisper comes over the comm from the Falken. "What kind of force are they sending that can stand a chance against all of this firepower?"

"Theres really only one possibility. They must be sending Unit X itself..." 

---

"Wait, did we bring the DGG-04? I kinda wanted to give it to Irm for the time being while we make the Neo Grungust."

*I absorbed it into my body to save space, I can produce it again once we get back.*

"Cool. Any luck with the Judecca?"

*Its almost done. These crystals in its armor... they're quite extraordinary, and their potential properties tell me a great deal about what the Balmarians were capable of at their hieght. Any luck with Hackman?*

"Er... she's groggy, but she'll be fine, she's asking that we speak with the Balmarians right away... Uh, Dumi, the DC people are giving me a lot of dirty looks... You have a contingency plan, right?"

*The battleship has several links to the ODE system, so I have a backdoor into its controls if we need to hijack it. As for personal combat, I'm sure you and your new friends can handle that.*

---

*Alright, Katina, I have a wavelength to the Balmar ship. You and Patricia start negotiations, while I talk to Juergens about things.*

"Cool!" You pull the comm unit over to Patricia's bedside, and await her transmission.

"This is Patricia Hackman, er, Sample PD/NT-001. I must talk to Laodicea Gozzo immediately, it concerns the humans."

There is no response for a minute or two, then a man's voice, with a tinny quality similar to Aquijas translation unit, comes over the comms. "Hackman... We've ascertained you're not on the Neviim anymore. What exactly has happened?"

"Er, well..."

"Hi, I'm Katina Tarask, and I'm in charge of the mission to rescue our people. Sorry about all the ruckus we caused, but you kinda didn't leave a 'We're not evil' sign in front of your oversized tennis-ball there. Now, you and me both have a problem, and that problem is the Earth Federation Army. So I was thinking, maaaaybe we should team up and kick ass a little."

Laodicea doesn't respond for a few seconds, but you're used to that. "Earth woman, I am the last commander of the Balmar Fleet, and guardian of the last remnants of our race. I will not enter into any action unless it helps secure the future of our race. And given your actions, and the theft of the Judecca, I'm not inclined to think that you're the best person to be talking to!"

He seems irritated. You're used to that.

 "I-I-I-I'm sorryyyyyyybuhuhu!!"

"?!"

"I just thought it was those EFA fascists or the idiots from the DC! I didn't know the Neviim was your last hope! I didn't knooow!!"

"Er, Earth-woman, I..."

"But you have to beleive me! The Shadow Mirrors are the only ones you can trust! The EFA will kill you, and so will the DC, probably! We're looking for allies, for friends, but they just want control. Ok, the DC more want to kill aliens just because, but still! We're your only hope!!"

"I don't understand, not all of these terms are in our database..."

"We'll even give you your Judecca back! I promise!!"

"R..Really? But we'll also need a psychodriver to operate it, can you also provide one? And I'll need full out-to-date information on your planets great houses."

"But if we get you all that, you'll work with us?"

"As long as it ensure the survival of Balmar, yes."

Patricia just blinks at you. "Deee-Seee?"

---

"Dumi, Low-Dick wants full info on the factions on earth. Can you handle that while I explain things to the others?"

*That shouldn't be a problem.*

"...And could make yourself look less like an icky eyeball wing monster? It might get in the way of the negotiations?"

*I had thought of this. If this bodies mass were a little higher, I could probably simulate a space vessel. Maybe a Tausendfeussler would do for now...*

"I was thinking something a little more... petite."

*A word implying not only small, but feminine. Why am I not surprised?*

"Oh come on Dumi! If you turn yourself into a cute teenage girl there'll be no way they can say no to you!"

A*ccuracy of that statement aside, I'm not sure I can do that... safely. Shrinking this body to that size runs the risk of energy overload from the mass conversion, and creating an autonomous avatar... I couldn't be sure that such a being would still be me.*

"Ugh... why not?"

*I've done it before. Three times in fact. And the resulting Homunculi all developed distinct personalities. It's how I stayed sane through all the long years watching this planet before the Balmarians came. Far better to let Despinis act in my stead, I can feed her my lines, and she'll happily repeat them.*


---

"This is all very confusing..." Radha shakes her head as she sits down. "The soldiers on this ship seem to imply they're... enemies of the EFA. Is that even possible?"

You grin slightly at the assembled crowd. "Its real possible. I mean, you guys've been gone since the PTX-Aggressors era, right?"

*It takes a bit of date-checking, but it seems everyone was taken within a month or two of each other.*

"Well, a couple of months after, the EFA started to clamp down on unrest in the colonies with their new PTs. After from two major innocents, this went mostly unopposed, but caused a lot of resentment. Then a guy called Bian Zoldark, head of a conglomerate of businesses and scientists called the Extraterrestrial Oversight and Technological Intervention group, secretly created an army and tried to topple the EFA. He claimed that aliens were trying to take over the Federation government, and he had to unite humanity to stop them. The Divine Crusaders fought fiercely for months, but all they really achieved was getting the EFA to kick PT production into overdrive. Zoldark was killed in his base by a special team, and the surviving DC split into factions, just about holding out against the EFA."

Radhas eyes nearly pop out of her skull. "S-such madness! A war so great, over one mans lunacy?"

"Er... Thing is, he might have had a point. We recently got some first-hand evidence of our own that things aren't totally earth-y up in Geneva. As in, the top PT teams seem to have a few too many tentacles to be Earth-made..."

"H-how? Who?"

Patricia blinks "It can't be the Balmarians... Is it the Zuvorg Alliance?"

"All we know is that they call themselves the First and Only, they're butt-ugly, and they're kinda secretive about it, for now." 

The room is incredibly quiet. Radha shakes her head in disbeleif. Kar-Wai looks incredibly shaken. Tytti is enthralled.

Patricia puts her hand under her chin pensively. "If the EFA really are compromised, th-then... Can there be peace between Balmar and Earth? Will this... different government allow the Balmarians to land and settle?"

You shrug. "Probably not. Hence why we'll need to convince the Balmarians to help us fight the EFA and topple those tentacled bastards!"

Kar-Wai looks at you oddly. "Who exactly is this 'we' you keep mentioning?"

"The Shadow Mirrors are... a group that oversees and equips the resistance movements opposed to the EFA. We beleive that the internal strife in the EFA, the secret cold war between the aliens in Geneva and the other factions of the EFA, isn't good enough. The whole thing needs to dragged out into the open, and the people armed and prepared to take back their rights and their planet. We've been putting pressure on the EFA for years, and its finally paid off by getting the alien masters to show themselves, but at a high price. Our command structure was recently hit hard, and we've been looking for new oppurtunities, like this one."

Radha is looking really worried. "S-so you work with these DC to keep the fighting going?!?"

"...Parts of the DC. They're a pretty fractured bunch, and all very independently-minded."

"H-how can you think that a never-ending war can be good for humanity?"

You shrug. "It's either that or become sex-toys for bored aliens. I choose to fight."

Kar-Wai is shaking his head. "I just find it hard to beleive... What kind of evidence do you have?"

"Er... I can get gun-cam images from the Rai-oh if you like. I got a good look at that Albero guy who I saved Kai from."

"...Perhaps from the horses mouth would be better. Can I talk to Kai?"

"Hmmm... Dumi, I think the EFA knows were we are by now, surely its safe to call home?"

*The EFA fleet have gone to full alert and overboosted between us and Earth, and set up ECM. A direct line to Earth is impossible, our only hope would be to bounce it off the colonies, and for that to work, we'd need to use the DC channels. I've already promised Juergens a lot, a risky move like this may cost me more than I'd like.*

"Damned EFA and their damned jamming! Dumi, you've got to come up with a way to get around that shit, I'm sick of it!!"

*...I do have a method, actually, but it would be a little... hard to implement.*

"Huh?"

*My Hyperwave communicator is uneffected by electromagnetic jamming, so I can contact my Homonculi at will. If you haven't guessed already, Cynthia, or rather, Tis, is one of them.*

"Huh? I thought... oh wait, you mentioned about the machine cells."

*I had to have Tis disguise herself, because I couldn't risk the Irregulars recognising her. I have my suspicions they're looking for me.*

"So you can get a message to our guys, but you can't hook Kar-Wai up with Kai?"

*Well... that depends on who will listen to 'Cynthia' and beleive her when she says she has a message from me that no-one else can get. Its a risk, particularly if the Irregulars are nearby at the time.*

"Mr. Kitamura?"

Kai turns from where he's working on his Gespenst, and faces the grey-skinned girl. "Oh, hello. Haven't had a chance to talk to you yet, was sorta curious about the medical functions of those wierd cells of yours."

"Well, I'm afraid we'll have to discuss that later, I have something a bit more urgent to talk about?"

Kai frowns. "What exactly might that be?"

"Would you like to meet someone called Kar-Wai Lau?"

---

Shuu looks up as Kai storms into the Tausendfuessler. The ex-EFA soldier looks at Ryuune and Masaki out of the corner of his eye, and begins to whisper to the mysterious scientist. 

"Dr. Shirakawa, I need a favor."

"And that might be?"

"I need you to take your Granzon and take us to space, to help Katina and Dumi. They've had some... interesting developments happen, but they need help. And not the sort that the others can give them."

"Something only the Granzon can accomplish... It's understandable. But if I end up damaging the space-time continuum, it's on your head."

Kai grins. "Sure." 

---

Laodicea rests his chin on his folded hands and looks at the clone before him. "What is the status of the Barshem Series?"

Bet Barshem nods at her commander. "Alef Barsham was lost in the initial contact with Entity-02, we are preparing another. We had to decant most of the series to make room for more Native Balmarians, so we only have half a dozen currently. We can begin mass-producti-"

Laodicea turns to the large bearded man beside her. "Doban, our forces?"

"I'm captain of the guard, not of these investigation fleets. I'm not used to all these drones and remote units..."

"Do we have enough to defend ourselves, Doban?"

"For now, but we'll need capital ships if we're going to get anywhere actually taking this planet."

"Qayits, has the Hyperwave unit revealed anything of the fleet?"

Luria shakes her head. "No direct contact with any of the fleet commanders in the databanks. There are echoes of fleet communications, but nothing intelligible, and none directed at us."

Laodicea sighs. "Have we been abandoned by my brothers? Are we adrift?"

Baran grunts and steps next to Laodiceas desk. "Commander, we don't have time to mope about our situation! We cannot warp from this system, and we need time to rebuild our defenses! We must prepare to defend ourselves from these earthlings!!"

"I know, but I still do not trust this Entity. Its claim that the previous attack was an error is highly suspicious, and its taken Judecca, our best combat unit..."

"Screw Euzeth's slithering science-lab! We can stand alone if need be. We need only a few cycles to prepare a strike unit, and cripple the Earthlings main resources."

"Your ambition is lauded, Baran Doban, but I fear it may take more than that. I'll give you 5 cycles to secure our position in this system, otherwise, I'll have to activate Zehirut, and begin Adjudication."

Baran blinks, and then nods and turns to leave. "Zehirut... no way to fight a war, I say..." 

---

"The Eurydice is still refusing hails. They keep sending coded laser signals claiming special circumstances, but no codes to back that up, Captain."

"Understood. How long to targets?"

"22 minutes to the group of capital ships. Positive ID on a DC vessel, negative on the spherical object. The Asteroid is emitting noticable energy readings now, theres definitely something in th... Gravitational Distortion dead ahead!! I'm picking up 2 PTs, one a Gespenst, the other ...unknown."

"Yellow alert! Minimise jamming and give me a commlink."

"...This is Dr. Shuu Shirakawa, scientific savior of Earth. I ask that you stand down and leave this situation to me, so that the unknown desires of your corrupt masters can be held off another day."

"Wh-what? How can you make such demands?"

"In the name of Justice and Freedom, I beg you not to force my hand. This can be solved peacefully, if you simply retreat and let my superior intellect handle things."

"Superior... Doctor, I'm giving you one minute to surrender your mech or my fleet will open fire."

"I feared as much. I hope you share what happens next with as many people as possible, it'll save pointless battles in the future."

The Granzons chest opens. 

---

Lefina Enfield gulps and tries to remain calm. "Lt., I know you're confused and angry at this situation, but I don't think pointing a gun at the Captain will solve things."

Despinis looks down the barrel of the pistol with the same indifferent expression she has while filing paperwork. "Lt. Gunther, if you want to relieve me of command, there are formal procedures to follow. Holding me at gunpoint is not one of them."

"Shut up you goddamned robot! You've gone mad, allying us with terrorists, bringing to a hellhole full of alien shit, and then making us watch while your buddies wipe out an entire fleet!! Who the fuck do you think you are!?!?"

"The fleet was disabled, not wiped out. This mission requires some sacrifice of material, bu-"

"SHUT UP!! There is no mission, is there?!?! You're just making sure your alien buddies kill as many of our friends as possible! Well fuck you! Get out of that chair, and maybe we'll see if they leave you alive long enough to be dissected!"

*You're being incredibly rash, Ramon Gunther. If you truly beleive Despinis is an alien, why threaten her with a weapon that can only harm humans?*

Gunther jerks his head around to see where the voice is coming from. The half-second distraction is all that it takes for Despinis to leap up, chop him in the neck to stun him, and crush the pistol in her hands. 

"So... we're abandoning the charade?"

*I never liked the charade to begin with. And don't pretend you did either.*

Despinis twitches, in what could almost be called a shrug. "If any of you wish to remain loyal to the EFA, you should get to the lifepods. Take Gunther with you. Those who stay are declaring their allegiance to a new order, where Humanity will be cleansed of its corrupt bureacracy and secret overlords, and returned to its true nature.

*One by one, the frightened crew exit the bridge. Gunther is dragged out, still cursing the captain. The door shuts behind them.*

Despinis turns to the only other person left in the room. Her face twitches into something that could almost be a smile.
