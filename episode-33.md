# Episode 33

##SRWQ Mission 33: Surprisingly Vincible Under The Heavens

In our last thread, our heroine Katina Tarask decided not to kill her long-missing boss Vindel Mauser, and grudgingly decided to accompany him until Dumi came to pick her up.

Unfortunately, Dumi has been cornered by the Irregulars from the OG-Verse, and forced to reveal his identity. He holds off the suspicious ex-Aggressors with a doom-laden prophecy, that this universe has been blockaded by dark forces, and the Irregulars are trapped. Now, Axel Almer is forced to give up his one big bargaining chip, the Zweizergain, in order to save his allies from the SRX Team...

---

"Lemon's gonna kill me... Ok, Irregulars, you get the Zweizergain, but on two conditions. One, you help us save our friends, and that Arado kid. Two, you keep the Zweizergain in one piece until we have time to discuss this properly. Ok?"

"Agreed!" Gilliam, Sanger and Ratsel speak as one.

"Ok! Head after that big-boobed doll!"

Lamia's comm window pops up. She's still wearing Axel's original uniform, although his replacement is almost identical. "Wh-where do you get off calling me that!? I'll show you I'm not just some dress-up toy!"

The Angelg accelerates to maximum, overtaking its allies and drawing its blade as it runs down the fleeing EFA.

"This is Colonel Yuuki Jegnan to the pursuing Shadow Mirrors. Break off, or we will be forced to destroy you."

Axel snorts. "Hah! We've just sent you scurrying back to your ship with your tail between your legs, and now you're gonna turn around and beat us? Thats not how fights work, Mr. Jegnan."

"You haven't seen a fraction of this teams power, Axel Almer. I highly suggest that you back down."

Gilliam pops up on a private channel. "Axel, he's talking about combining his main three robots into one Super Robot, the SRX. Even with the damage we've caused, they should still be able to do it."

"Whats one super robot? We've got half a dozen."

"If their SRX is anything like ours, its power is off the charts for an earth-made robot. Particularly with the R-Gun there. Our combined forces against the SRX and Kurogane... I'd say it'd be an even fight. And we wouldn't come out of it unscathed."

---

"Eun?"

The Kurogane's captain checks her sensors. "The enemy are still in pursuit. I'm preparing an barrage."

"Ok, keep them off our backs." Yuuki points to the open hatch atop the Kurogane, and Tenzan and the Black Knight fly down to drop their captives off.

Ring in the Huckebien EX
Star Team (Armorlion, Vegalion, Altairlion)

Ryuune, Masaki and Bullet arrive next turn.
```
---

"Chief, cover us!" The Vegalion and Altairlion soar skyward, laser guides locking on and flaps opening as they prepare for their union.

"Right... Square Cluster!!" Dozens of missiles fly out, throwing the surviving EFA units into disarray. Few find targets however, most simply fly into the Kurogane's belt armor.

"Taking the shot!" The Angelg draws its bow and fires as the Kuroganes barrage falters. The arrow of plasma flies into the open hatch and bursts against the lift mechanism, jamming the elevator. The Soldifar and the Schutzwalds cockpit are still visible, in the middle of the Kuroganes deck.

"Ring, I'm suited up, need a hand."

The Photon Rifle shot scores a glancing hit on an R-0, while the huckebien boosts away from the return fire of its friends. "Jayce, good to hear from you. Swing by the 'Fuessler and pick up the Black Hole Cannon. Man, really gotta organise a delivery system for that thing..."

---

ENEMY PHASE

"Carla, Tango Formation, on the AM!"

"Right!" The R-Gun launches two blades which connect in mid-air and fly off without visible propulsion, glowing with green energy. It flies past the Armorlion, which dodges to one side, then the other as a Boosted Rifle shot goes past.

"Gonna take more than tha-" The rifle round, deflected by the telekinetically hardened metal, flies into the rear of the Armorlion. Something pops, and its right thruster starts spewing smoke. Denzel curse as his mobility takes a nosedive. Then the boomerang takes a gouge out of his shoulder as it flies back to the R-Gun

Beams burst off the Angelgs armor as the StealthFalken opens up. Multiple images of the feminine mech appear as it evades, but the shots still strike true. Lamia grits her teeth as the damage racks up.

Two Strike-Shields fly right through an after-image of the Huckebien, ploughing on through and almost hitting an R-0. Ring dodges frantically as the things swarm around her. She dodges past the Kuroganes wing, and three of them crash straight through it, after their target.

---
```
TURN 2: Available Units
Lamia in the Angelg
Ring in the Huckebien EX
Armorlion
Hyperlion
Cybuster
Valsione
Brooklyn in R-Blade

Axel and Latooni arrive next turn.
```
---

"Give it up, Jegnan, you can't beat what we got."

"Oh? I think we're doing quite well, actually."

"I won't deny you're good, but you don't have a hope of coming away from this if you don't give us back our people! You can keep the computers, the spare parts, and everything else your agents took, but the Shadow Mirrors keep their people safe!"

"...Odd words, coming from a dead man."

"Screw you, pretty boy. Maybe you'll reconsider once I've parceled up your ass and mailed it to your mom."

The Cybuster flashed through the AAA, and positions himself just clear of the stuck hatch. Turrets swing to track him.

"Too slow! CYFLASH!!!"

The energy storm rips a dozen small turrets, and one large one, right off the Kurogane. The R2's paint bubbles and flakes off as its catapulted upwards. The wounded R-0 flies into a dozen pieces. The other units race out of the blast radius in wide arcs.

With the deck cleared, Ryuune swoops in low, and grabs for the battered Soldifar. "Arado, are you ok?"

"...What is with this world and all the crazy women?"

Lamia launches arrow after arrow at the black mech, but the Falken climbs and spins higher and higher, before zooming down, guns blazing. Try as she might, Lamia can't dodge any of the shots: The accuracy is uncanny.

"Damn you! I won't be beaten here, not in front of him!" The Angelg draws its blade and charges at the Falken, with Lamias roar coming across the comms. Theres a strangled squeak, and the Falken seems to faint, reversing its Tesla drive to dive away faster.

Ring chops at one of the Strike Shield, but the high-powered Roche Saber doesn't cut through, and is nearly twisted out of her grip. "It's just titanium, how can they be so durable?" She rakes the Huckebiens head around, and Gatling rounds ricochet off the R3, but the Powered frame is too large for them to do much.

The Armorlion's beam guns rapid-fire at the R-1, but the mech smoothly swerves out of their path, almost mockingly. Behind Denzel, the R-Gun flies up, magna rifle pointed at the other thruster.

"Carla, above!!"

The R-Gun jerks backwards as four blades made of pure speed flash past it, almost slicing of the gunbarrels and the units face. The red-and-white assemblage flashes down, spins, and comes back up, guns and missiles blazing. Carla desperately gatlings down the missiles, but several powerful shells slam into her.

"Agh!! How...How can an AM have this kind of performance?"

"Don't forget, they made the Valsion, and they have alien tech now too. But don't worry about that, get ready for the real fight!"

Elsewhere, two R-0s become four, and promptly explode as the R-Blade flies past. Brooklyn sighs. "All the true foes seem to be taken..."

"Tenzan?"

"G-got control, just about."

"Kobayashi?"

"NNnnnghhaReady."

"Eun?"

"Support program punched in!"

"Ok, unlocking the codes. Pattern OOC, engage!!"

ONLY ONE CRACH

"...They still haven't fixed that?"

Mazagines on the Kurogane erupt, and mortar rounds arc across the battlefield, bursting into clouds of cloying chaff. Lasers bounce through the mirrored shards, and ECM pulses, as the Kurogane ceases to be a battleships and contents itself to be a giant distraction.

"Tronium engine, cooking like a chef!"

"Nendou Fiirudo, ON!"

"Why do you always say it that way, Kobayashi?"

The three mechs fly in line, glowing with ethereal strength. Ring takes a shot, but the photon burst bounces off. Beams from the Armorlion aren't even registered. From extreme range, Latooni fires missiles, but they crumble to nothing under the green glow.

The formation flies under the Kurogane as they start to transform, and as the smoke and chaff dissipate, something very different rises from behind the battleship.

"Shadow Mirrors, meet the SRX, The Great Destroyer. None may see its face, and live."

"It doesn't have a face, it has an oversized pair of novelty sunglasses."

"You're a real mood-killer, Axel Almer..."

Halfhearted joke attempt. I know, most of the status weapons are fairly ridiculous.

Though I'll admit, the image of a Gespenst tossing a giant net over the Judecca and then proceeding to drain its energy by plugging a bunch of cables into it like some kind of robot vampire is amusing. At least it makes more sense then the RV's Vampire Beam. I still want to know exactly how that works.

"I think ridding the world of an uncouth ruffian who can't appreciate botany is worth my time..." The SRX's chest begins to open as Axel charges.

"Keep the rest of them off my back!"

Lamia swipes at the StealthFalken, which keeps boosting away and firing wild shots: The pilots former incredible accuracy is gone in the panic of close combat. A graze from the Mirage Sword sends the Falken scrambling through the jungle to get away.

Ring shoots the last R-0 in the face, and Brooklyn stabs it, before they both dive away from a brace of missiles from the reawakening Kurogane.

Star Team round on the wounded R-Gun, which dances a desperate dance to evade the many, many bullets and missiles coming at it. One Seiphard gets too close...The R-Gun tumbles towards the jungle, its Twin launchers shattered.


Seeing a flash, Ryuune brings up her blade just in time to deflect the Cold Metal Sword.

"He stays with me!" The StealthWurger kicks the Valsione in the gut, sending it flying against the side of the elevator. The Black Knight reverses the blade and blocks the Discutter.

"Arado is our friend, and we won't let anyone take him against his will! It's happened too many times before."

"Fool! The School is where those of true will are forged!" The Knight and Masaki weave a web of steel, while the Soldifar with only one arm movable, looks about for a weapon...

The StealthRaubtier flies over the fight, beam cannon charged. Latooni boosts towards the bridge, looking for her oppurtunity...But the instant before she fires, a cluster mine goes off, peppering the air around her with shrapnel, and the shot goes just a little too far to the left. "Damn...they can see through the stealth coating!!" She dodges along the hull, grateful for the machine cell which are already filling in the damaged sections.

ENEMY TURN

The two blades connect. Axel was sure he had a clean strike, but the SRX's blade, glowing with pure psychic energy, appeared in front of him. The shock of connection travels up the Vaisagas arm, and the feedback numbs Alexs hands. The Vaisaga is pushed away by the sheer force of the weapons radiance. Where the Vysaga's blade any weaker, he was sure it would have snapped.

"Holy...Its worse than Beowulf! How do the EFA keep making these monsters!"

"CARLAAA!!!" The SRX turns to see its companion mech impact on the jungle below.

"D..Damn you all! I was going to go easy on you..But now...THIS ENDS!!!"

STRIKE
DRIVE
VALOR
ZEAL

The blade shines like a nuclear bomb, and for a moment, it looks like the sky has been divided in two. Then, as the light fades, the battlefield seems emptier.

The burning hulk of the Armorlion, and the damaged Hyperlion it tried to shield, float down into the jungle.

The SRX turns to Axel again.

Why would Axel need to dodge when the sword isn't even formed yet?

Not to mention, as long as the chest is open some rather delicate internal mechanisms should be exposed.

Throw some of Vysaga's shuriken at it, and hope to hit some of the more sensitive systems. And THEN dodge if necessary.

Also, focus some fire on the R-Gun when you get a chance. Taking that out can at least spare us the terror of an HTB Cannon.

Axel dodges. It moves to intercept, propelled by psychic force.

Axel turns on his after images. The sweeping eyebeam cleaves through them all, charring the Vysaga's shoulder nearly half-way through.

Axel blocks.

The Vysagas hands come off.

The ultra-fast, ultra-deadly super robot flies through the air in fragment, like the remnants of a clay pigeon. Its sword spins into the distance.

"WHO'S NEXT!? WHICH OF YOU BASTARDS WANTS SOME MORE?"

"Yuuki, stop, you're draining too much from Kobayashi. You'll kill her!!"

"SHUT UP! LET THE DUMB BITCH DIE! THEY HURT CARLA!!"


Ratsel cocks the Lanzekannones. "It appears that Axel Almer has begun something he cannot finish."

Sanger raises the Zankatou, and extends it to its full length. "Then it falls to us to finish it, my friend. Gilliam, keep the Zweizergain safe. We'll be back presently."

Daizengar is the only thing that can even hope to stand up to the SRX on even terms now, but Roid Rage Yuuki will make him work for every bit of it. DGGs need to blitz the SRX, and hard. If Lamia has any energy left, get her up in the sky and start dropping Phantim Phoenixs on its head as well.

Masaki, Lune, Ring, and Bullet keep hounding the Stealth Wilds. Have Latooni move to cover the downed Hyperlion and Vysaga, if she can.

Ratsel and Sanger work to keep Yuuki pushing the SRX to go at full power. Tenzan will either force it to split, or Aya will die. Either way, it will then be neutralized. Meanwhile, have some of the others go and support Masaki, and others go recover pilots. We don't want Axel or the Stars dying on us yet. Especially since we don't even have the Virgolas yet. Might as well try to recover Carla to use as a bargaining chip if she isn't dead yet, too.

"And who do you think you are?"

"I AM SANGER SOMBOLD, THE SWORD THAT CLEAVES EVIL! SRX Team of this world, back down at once, or face the might of my Zankantou!!"

"And my Trombe!"

"Impudent bastards! The SRX has slaughtered dictators and ended alien empires! What can you two do."

"SHUT UP, AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!"
Aside from the Stealth Coating, the Wurger of this dimension had other differences from the one Masaki and Ryuune knew. Namely, a second Cold Metal Sword.

The Black Knight fends of both opponents, clashing blades with both of them as all three dance around the confined space of the elevator shaft. Cuts appear on all three, but the Wurger feels them the least, with its jacket armor.

"Wow! This girls good!" Ryuune pauses a split-second to catch her breath.

"I'm not just good, I'm the best!!" Sparks fly as a prana-enhanced blow from the Discutter is stopped with both blades. The Wurger piroquettes and elbows Cybuster away. "Where it not for the secret nature of my work, you'd know of me even in your own back-woods world!"

Rifle and Bit Gun lost, heat knife snapped in two, shoulder launchers disabled...A light goes on in Arado's head. He forces open the lid of the launcher, and pulls out some of the missiles. "Ouka! Catch!!"

The Black Knight turns and brings up a blade, expecting another swordblow. The missiles crack, showering her face in shrapnel. It's only a momentary distraction, but that enough in this type of fight.

The Divine Blade goes right through the left arm. The Discutter through the upper torso. One of the blades clangs against the deck. The Wurgers knees shake as the two Irregulars force it down.

"Now...give it up!"

"Not while I still breathe, Invaders. CAST OFF!!"

The two giant mechs land on the Kurogane, the impact gouging the armor. Their blades are locked together, Liquid metal against psychic force. Neither will back down, though the very act of keeping the blades together takes their all.

"Tenzan!! Where is my power output? We should be able to throw this bastard around like a ragdoll!"

"I'm telling you, its not the damned Tronium Engine, its Kobayashi! She can only give you so much strength! Switch to conventional weapons, you lovestruck buffoon!"

"I can't...budge from here..."

Lanzekannone shots bounce across the TK Field, and into the turrets aiming at the Dygenguar. It seems like this stalemate will only end with one side breaking


"AXEL!! Dammit, you bastard, you can't do this to us twice!" Lamia lands beside whats left of the Vysaga. Theres a lot less than there should be. The only part that looks to be in one piece is the sword, which is cherry-red and setting nearby tree aflame.

"Get up, you dumb, prejudiced, inconsiderate bastard!"

"Ugh...wussa?"

"Axel! Are you alright??"

"....You sound like a very pretty young lady. What's your name?"

"Eh...Lamia, Lamia Loveless."

"I'm Axel Almer, pleased to meet you. Now, would you mind telling me where I am?"

Oh my, Amnesia Axel has arrived. I hope he won't be like that for too long.

Permanent Shadow Mirror Lamia is alot more emotional compared to her non-Shadow Mirror counterpart.

>>4628998

Probably cause he was relatively funny(and a bit of a dumbass I think) when you chose him in Advance. I hope he doesn't stay that way too long, it's rather odd considering everyone started with serious mode Axel.

Also, Use the Tatsumaki Zankantou. the combo uses the power from both machines, which should be enough to pierce the TK field, and "dis-arm" the SRX, leaving it with only the Blade Kick attack.

"Let the sword go, Yuuki! Take the hit, then Dominion Ball this overcompensating bastard. Or fuck, just Genocider him here and now!! Don't just stand there, the other one is blowing holes in the field!!"

"Urgh....Carla, you're alive, help us...."

"YUUKI!!!"

The stern, imperious voice cuts through the tension. "It's alright, Nakajima. I'll handle this."

"Huh? D...Director??"

"Jegnan, Kobayashi-02, shutdown command Agito. Initiating T-Link Planetary Contact. Reios Driver, on!!"

Tenzan looks goggle-eyed at his monitors."My god...She's piloting the whole damned mech herself, from Japan!!"
"Running away, Bronzo 27?"

The StealthFalken glances over its shoulder at the approaching Raubtier. The mousy whisper comes over the comms. "Latooni 11....Please...no closer..."

"You never could stand being close to another human being, could you? Couldn't stand them. A brush of a finger and you'd curl up in a ball, sobbing. A pinch and you'd squeal like a stuck pig."

"N-no...keep away, you've already beaten me!"

"I don't do this for victory, Seolla. I do this for the risk. And a mid-air grapple with a twitchy psychopath sounds risky to me."

"nonononononNONONONONONO"

"Besides, I left Russel to get himself killed. I can't let a drunken irishman show me up.

The StealthRaubtier transforms, and with a final boost, bears the Falken to the ground.

Evil Axel dies exactly like he does in OG 2, full of rage and damning the W-Series(may be paraphrased, I need to reread the dialogue translation but its very similar)

Lamia on the other hand dies not truly understanding the free will of humans and some other relatedness. Axel calls her a failure since she doesn't truly understand what it is to be human.

Not sure how the hell we're going to win this now, and without Katina I have no feasible outlet for my irrational hotblooded decisions.

Therefore, I would like to point out that, should we destroy the SRX, make sure to avoid damaging the Tronium Engine as much as possible. Aside from the fact that some Tronium would be a much-needed resource and/or bargaining chip, the explosion from the Tronium Engine if it's destroyed could level a city.

The R-Gun struggles to its feet, only to find itself with a blade to the throat. Brooklyn Luckfield salutes with his free hand.

"A good show, ma'am, but I'm afraid the party is over for you. Soon as Ring comes back with her big gun, your ship will be disabled and the party will be over."

Carla lets fly with a torrent of curses. The mighty SRX team, humiliated by a bunch of terrorists? Had the team faltered that badly since the victory over the Inspectors? Had the rot set in that badly.

Then the R-Gun begins to glow.

"Wh..TK Energy? From where?"

Before Bullet can even twitch, the R-Gun is yanked into the air, Carla screaming as she realises what's happening.
The Psychic Blade explodes, throwing Sanger and Ratsel back. The Zankantou warps under the stress and reverts to a katana to prevent stress fractures. Hull plating and turrets are blown off the Kurogane, and the SRX flies into the air, to be joined by an R-Gun that shouldn't be able to transform anymore, but still is.

"Carla, be a good girl and Twin Contact with me."

"N-no, I'm only meant to do it with Yuuki! I...I don't want you in my head! You mind is like ice!"

"Code: Dance And Brace."

"Ngghh..."

The handle of the R-Gun floats into the SRXs hand. "We've never fired the HTB Cannon without the Powered Equipment...Well, trial by fire, I suppose."

The giant mechs points the Metal Genocider down, towards the DC base. It pulls the trigger.

Everything goes white.
