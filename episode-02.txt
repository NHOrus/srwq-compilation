## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 2: The Q stands for Quest

You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask. You are equally as angry as the OG version, but because you were trained at The School, you are passive most of the time, releasing your anger in bursts of vengeful bloodletting. You also have similar dressing habits to Latooni and Seolla.

Having been tossed out of The School for one dead fellow student too many, You joined the Shadow Mirrors just before the EFA decided to try wiping them out. You took part in a desperate defense of the Tesla-Liecht Institute, while Vindel and Lemon put the finishing touches on the Lygeus portal, to send the entire organistion to another dimension, and start their work all over again.

Unfortunately, today is opposite day, and instead of you invading that world, you are being invaded by it.

You now have a slight problem. 

Your current forces:

You are in the R-Blade, a prototype stolen by the Shadow Mirrors so they can design the R-Eins. Its doing quite well so far but you've been quite rough on it, it could do with a repair. You've picked up a Mega Beam Rifle and a Lion Railgun to give yourself some more firepower, but you're not sure you have that much ammo left.

Your wingman is Russel Bagman, an Irishman who recruited you into the Shadow Mirrors. He seems to be good at multitasking, as he can pilot a mech as well as he can do intelligence work. He's flying a red Gespenst MkII-M, a well-armed Shadow Mirror with Tesla Drive and Slash Rippers. He's currently carrying the head-cockpit of a Randgrith, containing Ibis Douglas, who insists that the Gespenst belongs to Sliegh Priestly.

You're accompanied by Latooni Subota in a heavily damaged Randgrith. You remember her from The School as being top of the class at everything and something of a teachers pet. She barely remembers you and seems to be treating you as some sort of distraction so she can get better shots.

Somewhere behind you, Axel Almer is trying to balance his epic duel with Beowulf with the need to pay attention to what's happening with the portal.

Lying on the ground in front of the portal are Vindel Mausers Zweizergain and Lemon Brownings Ashsaber, both badly damaged when they came flying back out of the portal.

You haven't seen your command Irm Kazahara since you crippled his mech to force him to return to base.

Enemy forces:

Despite heavy losses, the EFA is still coming toward you, intent on ending the Shadow Mirrors. The regular forces are all but gone, but the elite Assault Team X-terminators have joined the fray, led by Beowulf, the EFA's top ace piloting the supposedly invincible Alt Eisen Nacht.

But that's nothing compared to the bewildering array of machines emerging from the portal. The main one is a massive black construction that looks like someone replaced the bridge of a battleship with the torso of a stylised Gespenst. Surrounding it are a bewildering array of mechs of types, many of which you've never seen before. This is worrying because your School training should let you recognise almost any mech on the planet.

There are at least 15 of the mysterious units:
2 Grungust-types, including one that looks like it's half-tiger.
A red version of Beowulf Gespenst MkIII, with a white Gespenst carrying a massive gun.
Two more vaguely Gespenst-types with similar armaments, flying on Tesla wings.
Something massive that looks like one of the Gigan series.
A giant samurai-looking mech, easily the size of Grungust, and another black and red one wielding beam pistols and rolling along on some like of skates.
3 Gespensts that have been noticably modified, two with heavy beam cannons, one with two sets of plasma stakes.
A group of three units that remind you quite a lot of the R-blade you're piloting, one white and blue wielding revolvers, one massively armored with twin 5-barrel shoulder cannons, and one red one attached to some kind of flight unit.

And behind them, a stream of yellow-brown mechs of a type you know you haven't seen, wielding photon rifles, coming out of the portal in waves.

You're still taking all of this in when a comm window pops up on you viewscreen. It's Irm.

"Katina? Remember the hangar we got our mechs from?"

"Uh, yeah."

"Remember the Tausendfuessler in the back?"

"Yeah!"

"Get in here. Now. We're blasting off."

THERE WILL A HALF HOUR DELAY WHILE I GET HOME FROM WORK.

WHAT IS YOUR INITIAL ACTION?

There is a moment of calm as the various sides try to get to grips with what exactly is happening.

Then the shooting starts.

The EFA open up first, firing everything they have at the newcomers. The new units respond instantly, their heavy units protecting their weaker units as their assault units blast forward, laying down counterfire as they blast past your group to the true threat. The three R-Blade types head towards the Zweizergain, but suddenly the Ashsaber reactivates, and launches its Sword Breakers, beams cutting up the tarmac as newcomers dodge desperately.

"Hangar G!! Head for Hangar G!! Theres a transport!!" You scream at your companions as you boost off, dodging EFA fire as you go. The rest head off after you: Russel takes Ibis' cockpit under his arm and charges with his head down, like a 20-meter tall rugby player, while Latooni's Randgrith begins stomping backwards, putting its remaining shoulder shield between it and the EFA while she fires off her remaining ammo.

You're almost there when your sensors show something coming up behind you. Its the big Tiger-Grungust, wielding a pair of nunchucks, and it looks like its about to pounce on you.

WHAT DO YOU DO?

"You!! Stop right there!! We need you t-" The young pilot was ready for a lot of things, but you turning 180 and charging right at him wasn't one of them. You fire both your stolen guns at the things face, and the effect is more like that time you set Seolla's pet kitten on fire than shooting a mech. Something like metallic fur burns off its face as the mech recoils as if in pain.

Both guns empty, you dive between the mechs legs and come up with your blade tonfas drawn. You leap at the things back, intent on a manuever you just came up with right now called 'slice-climbing', but suddenly, faster than you thought possible it whips around, and the nunchucks strike you in the side. You block the blow with your blades, but you still hit the ground hard.

"Koryuoh's not going to fall for a trick like that! Now hold still or I'll-"

"FECK OFF WHISKERS!!" Russels Gespenst slams into the mechs leg as it twists to face you, knocking it off balance too. Fast as it is, you're faster, and the two of you head through the hangar door as Koryuoh picks itself up.

Inside, the Tausendfuessler is warming up its engines, and you see Latooni running up the rear ramp into its cargo bay. At the far end of the hangar, there is a massive explosion as the half-wrecked Randgrith self-destructs, blowing out the far wall and revealing an escape route.

"You...you're not getting away! We need you to stop!" The Koryuoh charges at the transport, a spear appearing in its hands in a flash of flame.

"Suck my fumes!!"

You and Rusself dive into the Tausendfeussler as the engines burst into full power. The EOT reactors generates enough thrust, not only to push the massive transport into the sky, but to force back even the mighty Koryuoh. As the ramp closes, you see its mouth extend into a sea of fangs, and you hear a roar of monstrous rage.

ELSEWHERE

"Whatever your little toy there is, Axel, getting reinforcements out of thin air isn't going to be enough."

"SHUT UP BEOWULF!! I need to think!!"

"Slow in more ways than one..."

The Nacht ducks under a fist that could have felled a skyscraper, and digs its fist into the Soulgains abdomen. There is a loud BANG, and the Soulgain flies back into a lab building, a network of cracks like a spiderweb appearing in it armor.

"An army, ten armies, it doesn't matter how many you conjure up Axel, I'll take them all on! I'm the Monster Killer, I took down Zoldark and the Inspectors!! Nothing you can throw at me would ever be enough!!"

Axel gets to his feet, but he knows its too late, as the Nachts heat horn turns red and the Shoulder Claymores open up for the final blow...

"Ooh, this guy doesn't even sound like you, Kyosuke."

Beams of energy lance into the Nacht's shoulder launcher, popping the mechanisms in puffs of shrapnel.

"What in God's name are you talking about, Excellen?"

The Red Alt Eisen is obviously heavily modified, with heavier armor, massive thrusters, and a longer Revolver Stake which goes straight through the mechanism of the Nachts Stake, but somehow, it lacks the same presence. Axel squints at the new arrival, and he cannot be certain which one is actually larger.

"He doesn't do that sexy thing with his voice like you do."

Armor-piercing bullets smash off the barrels of the Nacht autocannons and its Heat Horn.

"...I have no idea what you're talking abou-"

The Alt Eisen Riese goes flying into the building next to Axel as the Nacht kicks out, before the blue demon blast into the sky and shoulder-charges the Weissritter, knocking the Oxtongue Rifle out of its hands.

Beowulf lands, and turns to his enemies both new and old. Already, its components are beginning to reassemble themselves, as if it was being rebuild by invisible.

"Even another me....won't be enough."

ANOTHER ELSEWHERE.

"Dammit!! shouts Bullet. "Kusuha, switch us to Ryukooh, we're going after them!"

"No!" Gilliams voice breaks in over the comm. "They're not important, just some Shadow Mirror troopers. Concentrate on the Zweizergain!! If we don't secure the System XN, this will be for nothing!!"

"Urgh...Right!"

Koryuoh turns and charges into the melee, as Sanger, Ratsel, and Gulliam head to support the SRX team and a full squad of Huckebiens.

They are drastically outnumbered.

Dozens of shadowy after-images of the Zweizergain surround Vindel and Lemon, some sporting the same missing arm as the original, others with completely different injuries, most completely unharmed.

"One lucky shot won't be enough, Helios! The Agyeus system has been improved drastically from the toy you left us. You're not just fighting my planet, you're fighting MY UNIVERSE!!!"

The shadows charge en-masse into the heros formation. Rai blasts one back into nothingness before two more grab the R-2s arms and fling him into the rusting hulk of a failed Grungust prototype. Sanger slices three into six parts before five use their Shadow Slicers together to block his blade. Even the Giest is being overrun, blowing away shadow after shadow as they fly at Gilliam, glowing red with destructive energy.

"Ugh! Stay focused! We've beaten him once, we can do it again!!"

Meanwhile the true Zweizergain back towards the busted Ashsaber. With no legs and one arm, Lemon's Assault Dragoon barely manages to lift itself to meet him.

"Well....this isn't going like we expected, is it?" grunts Lemon, as the R-3 Strike Shields swat her last Sword Breaker out of the air.

"No, but it's still survivable! This is the Alpha Event, Lemon! The distraction we needed, but never got! If we can get away, we can put the original plan in motion!"

Lemon wipes the blood out of her eyes, and grabs her secondary set of controls. The data cables which had connected to the Lygeus snake out from under the Ashsabers arm and plug into the few intact ports on the Zweizergain. "Your chronal displacer is shot, but the matter transducer is still up! My emergency escape program might just work..."

"Run it. We're out of time!"

As the Zweizergain's systems turn to a new purpose, the shadows begin to wink out. Seizing his moment, Bullet smashes two of them to fragments of smoke, and charges through to the two villains.

"No! Not now!!"

"AXEEEELL!!!"

"Variable Drill!! End this now!!!"

Theres is a flash. Then the opposite of a flash. On the other side of the field, the hijacked Lygeus portal coughs, spits out some rainbow-colored pieces of unreality, and shuts off.

The Zweizergain, Ashsaber, and Koryuoh are gone.

NOW BACK TO OUR ACTUAL PROTAGONISTS

You stow the R-Blade in a crash rig and exit the cockpit. From the outside, its quite obvious you've been incredibly harsh on the unit, the armor is buckled all over the arms and torso and most of the identifying marking have been sandblasted off by the force of all the near-miss explosion.

Looking around, you see what else is the hangar. You see the blue Gespenst and spare Randgrith you left behind earlier, as well as a large tank-like unit that seems familiar, but you can't quite place it.

Russel is also exitting his unit, holding onto his tweed cap as he hops down off the Gespenst, and Ibis is climbing out of her cockpit. You're not sure you've ever seen a person carrying so many guns before: She has at least 4 pistols on her belt, a holdout pistol in each boot, a belt of grenades over her shoulder, and she's retrieving an SMG from under her pilot seat. Latooni has vanished.

Your long-lost pal Irm's voice calls over the tannoy. "Welcome to Kazahara Airlines, ladies. Things are a little fuzzy at the moment, so perhaps you'd all like to come up to the bridge to have a chat and maybe a light aperatif."

"Er, what about me?" queries Russel.

"Sorry, there's no Guiness and no Lighter Fluid, so I guess you'll have to go thirsty."

WHAT DO YOU DO? DO YOU HAVE A PLAN?

You head up to the cockpit. There you find Irm manning the sensors and comms, an older man who looks a lot like Irm piloting, and Latooni in a corner seat, pouring over some maps and an iTablet.

"Irm, what the hell just happened?"

"You're asking me? I was just unpacking the Assault Lander from deep storage when Dad called me to say the portal had been compromised. What happened out there?"

"There were...lots of them. And I couldn't even recognise them!! That's not possible! I was trained!!"

"Not very well."

You swing around to where the comment came from. Latooni hasn't even looked up.

With a THWAP!!, Latooni's glasses go flying as you roundhouse her in the face.

"DON'T GIVE ME THAT BULLSHIT BITCH!! JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE SUCKING ADLERS WRINKLY COCK BETWEEN CLASSES DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO TALK DOWN TO ME!!!"

"Lass, stop it!!" Russel grabs your arms before you get a chance to hit Latooni again. "We're all feeling a bit high-strung, but we can't just turn on each other."

"I dunno..." muses Irm. "Hurting her allies seems to be a hobby of hers."

"Sh-sh-shut UP!!" You jerk around to face Irm, your eyes misting up. "Where....where are our friendly forces??"

"Finally, something sensible..." Irm turns to the sensor scopes again. "We have maybe a dozen units leaving the base headed south, and a transport headed southwest. I'm picking up the Soulgain's signal just entering the hills to the west, and that's about it...huh??"

"What is it?"

"I'm picking up friendly signals...to the north, where we're headed. They're about a hundred klicks north of the base, and they just appeared out of nowhere! They couldn't have sneaked up there, there was no time..."

Latooni has recovered her glasses, and has gone back to her maps, although she is rubbing her future black eye.


Russel lets your arms go and you take the chance to grab the comms speaker from beside Irm.

"Captain Axel! Come in Captain Axel!!!"

Theres a burst of static. "ZHZHZHHZHhe hell?"

"AXEL!! There were so many of them, we had to run away! What happened to you??"

"...There are two of him now."

"What?"

"Two Beowulfs."

"...what."

"You know, I was actually sorta looking forward to meeting a new Beowulf. I'd get to fall in hate all over again, have some fights, maybe even put the dog down this time and spare our new world his stinking presence. But him coming here...that's going to take some getting used to."

Irm grabs the mike back off you. "Are you seriously saying that the world we were going to head to is attacking us first? How the hell does that even work? How would they know we're coming?"

"I don't know and I don't care!! But right now, the Soulgain is damaged, Lemon's dissappeared, and our Beowulf is in retreat, and I'm a little too busy trying to evade these newcomers to worrying about interdimensional physics!!

You grab the mike back off Irm. "Axel, there's a group of our troops in the north, 100km from the base. You can head there and meet up with them, while we save some of our troops."

"....I kinda had hoped to find Beowulf, this was the first time his unit actually seemed to be damaged in a long while, but I guess that's as good a place as any."

"Great! We'll see you there later!"

"...If this is a trick, I'll personally kill you."

You toss down the mike and turn to the others. "Right! After that transport!!!"

It take a fair bit of convincing and a lot of using your moe-face to get Irm and Jonathan to turn the Tausendfuessler around and head to intercept the transport. As you complete the turn, you think you see the Soulgain far below you, heading north. TLI seems to be relatively intact, although wrecked vehicles are everywhere.

Irm finally manages to raise the transport. "This is Transport 32C, we've got 3 pilots and 2 mechs aboard. No sign of EFA pursuit....no wait, there are some coming! They're so fast, no way those are Gespensts."

"It's not the EFA, its the new guys. Right team, if we're really serious about saving these pilots and units..."

*moe-face*

"...and we are, we need to suit up and intercept the interceptors.

DEPLOYMENT

Your Pilots:

Katina Tarask
Irmgard Kazahara
Russel Bagman
Latooni Subota
Ibis Douglas

Units:
Red Gespenst
Blue Gespenst
R-Blade (Still not at 100%)
Randgrith (Has extra ammo)
Wierd Thingy

"Actually, now that it's important...what is that thing??"

Irm follows your gaze. "That? It's a spinoff from the Grungust line, the Assault Lander. It's based on the Type 1's Gust Lander form, to serve as an artillery platform and fortress assault unit, but then Dr. Albark joined TLI, and before you know it we were focusing all our attention on the Earthgain line."

Ibis perks up at the talk of heavy weapons platforms.

Ibis looks crestfallen as Irm climbs into the Assault Lander, but perks up when Russel offers her the Red Gespenst. You head over to the Randgrith, where Latooni is offloading the extra missiles and ammo for safe keeping.

"I...er...I'm sorry I broke your face earlier."
"I'm a full graduate of the School. A black eye isn't going to impair me in any noticable way."
"Still, it was cruel of me to do it. You were only right, I wasn't trained as well as you. You have so many assets that I don't have..."

*pinch*

"...But they will be mine."

Latooni stands straight as a statue as you walk to the R-Blade. The only reaction she gives is a low squeak.

Anyway, the Taussendfuessler and the Trilobite transport (pic related, thank you MAHQ) both drop altitude, so that your ground units can cover them. Ibis and Russel take off, and you and Latooni hop out as the Tausendfuessler nears the ground, followed by the A-Lander (kinda like the deployment of the Landmaster in Starfox 64).

Latooni turns her scopes in the direction of the TLI, at three dots just coming into view. "Enemy sighted. Two PT types, one with melee equipment and jacket armor, another with a long-range weapon. And one which appears to be a transformable type in flight mode."

"What, like those Wildraubtier Ms the EFA use for scouting."

"Similar design philosophy but vastly different construction. Elements of the Huckebien are evident."

"The Hu-hu-huckebein? The Vanishing Trooper? How would you even know that, no-ones even seen the thing!! It just dissappeared one day!"

"The design documents still exist in the Mao Industries databases. Full graduates of the School can gain access to such files. Perverted dropouts cannot."

"What did you just say...?"

"Girls, we have more important things to worry about!" shouts Russel.

The three bogies drop altitude and, sure enough, the plane-like one transforms into something shockingly reminiscent of your R-Blade.

The voice of an energetic young man sounds over the comms. "Shadow Mirrors, in the name of interdimensional peace, I ask you to surrender!!!"

You chamber a round into your borrowed m13 shotgun, and warm up your thrusters.

"Irm, Subota, snipe that sniper! Bags, other girl, capture the transforming one! I'll take the melee guy!"

"Wait! Katina, I'm in charge of this unit!!"

"ICANTHEARYOUIMTOOBUSYKILLING"

You boost straight at the Wuerger, your allies screaming in your ear. The Falken attempts to draw a bead on you, but you dodge the first few shots and then fire from the A-Lander and Randgrith force her to switch targets.

You hear the pilot of the R1 again. "Stop!!! We don't need to fight, we're trying to save the universe!!!", but he's distracted as Russel begins to fire on him, followed reluctantly by Ibis. It's just you and the Weurger.

"Oh, not going to play nice, huh? Just fine with me!!"

That voice...

You come to a screeching stop, and jump back as the vice-like thing on its right arm almost take your head off.

"You...you're dead."

"Huh?"

"You're Dead. I KILLED YOU!!"

"Katina???"

"AAAAAARGH GHOST GHOST GHOST!!""

You drop your shotgun and begin frantically wailing on the Wuerger, raining blow after blow down on a thouroughly confused Arado.

"Ah! Stop!! Katina!!" he yells as he desperatley tries to block your blows with the Stag Beetle Crusher.

"I'LL SEND YOU BACK TO HELL!!!"

Sparks fly as you score a big hit on the torso of the thing with the ghost devil in it. A normal mech would have been torn open by that blow, but the Wuerger's jacket armor means theres no significant damage. Arado kicks the R-blade to give him some room, and then desperately tries to gain altitude.
