# Episode 34

##SRWQ Mission 34: And now back to the real plot

In our last episode, nothing of much interest happened. So now we return to our true story, the adventures of Katina Tarask, wearer of frilly dresses and psychopathic paedophile.

We last left our heroine as she entered a bulk transport in order to escape the ruins of a Archeological site in China filled with Einst-corrupted Chokijin. Unfortunately, with so many different factions among the escapees, its a little confused as to the ultimate destination...

---

Vindel and Lemon stand impassively as the group of refugees debate their ultimate fate.

"We need to head south!!" Buller stands tall, fist raised in the air. "The Kurogane is there, our friends can protect us, and then we can plan properly what we're doing!"

Kai shakes his head. "Your friends are idiots, going so close to Izu Base. The EFA are already going to be coming here, going that way will just get ourselves lost faster. We head to India, lose ourselves in the Jungles, then cut across the ocean to Africa. The DC will handle us then."

"I'm not setting a foot in a base owned by that madman Vat Tran!!" Lily Junkers folds her arms. "We just return to our base in Russia. It's not the most comfortable, but its reliable. Besides, Juergens needs medical attention, and our base is closest!" She indicates the comatose man on the makeshirt gurney in the corner, still bleeding where his implants exploded.

Manami Hamill and her copilot sniff in unison. "Junkers, you've shown amply well that your facilities, and their safeguards, are well below grade. I suggest we stay well away from such a place. There are ELF cells in Australia that can handle us far better than your half-hearted measures."

Rand Travis and the deceptively child-like young woman with him shrug. "We're with Kai."

"Where the fuck is Dumi...?"

"Ms Tarask, do you have something to say?" Hamill raises an eyebrow.

"Why yes, yes I do."

"We go to Africa! All of us need power, and the only group that can give it to, that are from this planet anyway, are the Shadow Mirrors in Africa. We need Shuu, Dumi, Sophia and the rest to rebuild all the shit we lost, and better! Its really the only option!"

Theres a lot of grumbling from the DC and ELF, but Vindel and Lemon throw their lot in with you, and the vote is decided. The transport heads southwest, straight for the Himalayas, one of the few places on earth something that size can be hidden.

The different groups aboard split into their own factions. Bullet and Kusuha head to the hangar, to their mech: It seems they may be about to leave.

"Hey, where are you two off to? Cutting and running?"

Bullet looks at you worriedly. "N-no! It's just... we need to rejoin our friends. We've been out of contact for days, and we can't risk any more radio messages. It's best we just return to the Kurogane and sort everything out, figure out what the rest are doing."

"But... there are Irregulars in Africa too! You could meet up with Arado, Ryuune, Masaki, and that big-boobed girl they think I didn't notice!"

"W-wait... which one?"

"Bullet!"

"I-I didn't mean anything by that, Kusuha! I-its just not narrowing things down all that much."

Kusuha turns to you. "Well, maybe once we get to the Kurogane, we can get the two ships to meet up, and we can go to Africa together. Would that be alright, perhaps?"

"You could meet our Kusuha and Brooklyn..."

"Er... no, no thanks, it'd just get confusing then."

You shrug "Ok, whatever. Can that dragon-thing make it back to your ship on one tank of gas?"

"Er, Ryukooh doesn't use fuel, not as you'd know it anyway. It just sorta... goes."

"Wasn't it a giant tiger the time we met before?"

"That's Koryuoh. The two share the Type 3s body... its complicated."

"Can't be any more complicated than Dumi..."

"Who?"

"Never mind. Hey, one more thing... Did you know that guy Juergens in your world?"

Kusuha goes quiet, and looks at her shoes meekly. Bullet grits his teeth.

"I'll take that as a yes."

"He would have put Kusuha in that damned system of his... He was going to put everyone in it! The whole damned world, nothing but microchips in his giant computer. Still makes me sick to think of it..."

Kusuha turns to Bullet. "It's over now, Bullet-kun. And you can't influence Katinas view of this Juergens. Maybe in this world, he genuinely wants to help people..."

"Maybe, but I wouldn't hold out hope."

"Ah, Ms Tarask. Please, sit down." Lemon Browning seems none the worse for wear from her ordeal, her dress and makeup is in impeccable condition, considering not an hour beforehand she had run across a buddy battlefield and dived into a cockpit with the well-built Vindel Mauser.

You sit down in the conference room that the two Shadow Mirrors have commandeered. "So, Browning, what exactly have you two been up to since TLI?"

"When we teleported out of that fight, we landed in northern Germany, and were knocked unconscious, as were our pursuers. We were very fortunate that the ELF found us before the EFA, and that Manami Hamill is a sure-headed leader: Their lower ranks seem to think us responsible for the ELFs recent losses, when our support is the only reason the organisation exists at all."

"And they just kept you cooped up all this time?"

"Ms Hamill seemed to want to keep an eye on us, while stalling for time to gain a handle on the events of the past while, and to finish her excursion to China. It seems she's had her eye on Dr Anzai's mechanoids for some time, and the Irregular mech was the last piece of the puzzle she needed."

"But she's cool with you now? No more locking you up?"

"Hamill's main strength is her ability to know when to back down. She's gotten as much info from us and our mechs as she can get, any more would simply be... intrusive. Better to rekindle the two sides relationship on even terms."

"If there's enough to restart from..." Vindel sits up and turns to you. "You and your friend Kai have been rather vague on exactly what position the Shadow Mirrors are in. Would you mind being slightly clearer as to what this faction in Africa consists of?"

"We've got Axel, Irm, and all the survivors from TLI in two Trilobites. We also managed to pick up Echidna and all her wierd pod-people, and the staff of the Brazil branch. We've spend most of our time either running or making friends, and we've got a fair few deals going."

Vindel narrows his eyes. "Like who?"

"Thats something I'm not allowed to say. Negotiations are delicate, and we need operational security."

Vindel grimaces. "Young lady, I'm getting the distinct impression you don't like me all that much. Now I'll accept someone who's proven themselves, like Axel, giving me back-talk, but you're an unknown to me, with little but battle prowess and an attitude to show for yourself. You've hinted at your great achievements, but they you come across all coy. What, exactly, gives you the right to treat me like that?"

"I... *sniff* I-I... You're right, I should be more... respectful, but, after wh-what happened to me at the School, *sniff* I was never able... t-to get on with authority. It's why I joined the Shadow Mirrors, you know, b-because they were against authority. I guess I have... issues with that contradiction."

A thin smile breaks out onto Vindel's face. "Ah, this makes things clearer... The School, the School, the ultimate contradiction of the EFAs Izu faction. The only internal opposition to the gentle dictators in Geneva, and its main function is the turning of human hearts and minds into disposable weapons, meant for ultimate loyalty to a group of conspiratorial paranoids, locking themselves in with their ultimate weapons and watching the world turn black with the rot. Its no wonder so many of their runaways end up with us..."

He stands up and paces to one of the whiteboards attached to the wall. "I can't do much about what I am, I'm afraid. Someone has to take authority of Shadow Mirror, else all its strength would be wasted, much like the disparate rebel groups were achieving nothing before we turned them into the ELF. I don't relish my role, Ms Tarask, but I have to follow it. I won't have the Shadow Mirror become like the DC, rival groups following twisted parodies of Zoldarks original vision. If it means becoming a little like the people we fight... That's the price I'll gladly pay."

The door-handle twists, and Lily Junkers storms in. "Vindel, I need you to get that mustached mule of a man to stop this transport. Juergens is dying, he needs medical treatment, now!"

"I'll help him!!" You rocket out of your chair and past Lily, and jog to the medbay of the ship, before anyone can say a word.

The room is packed with wounded of all sorts, from people with cuts and broken bones to burn victims and people splashed with acid (likely from that darned snake). But even with all these people in need of bed space, Juergens has been given room to his own. That, or no-one wants to bleed near him.

The old man lies on his back, eyes searching about him, muttering under his breath. "Where are the others, I can't hear them, there should be more..." His external injuries seem minimal, but you stoop in closer and see the burns around the wires he's connected to his nervous system. Some sort of feedback has travelled through the ODE system and into the implants in his body. His internal organs have likely been half-cooked, and shrapnel will be swimming around in his body: Not the kind of thing you were taught how to treat in the School. They showed you how to patch up gunshot wounds with one hand, not how to perform neurosurgery on someone with imminent organ failure.

The mans eyes settle on you. "You... you're the one with The Core..."

You cast around looking for a real doctor to help him, but there only seem to be ordinary technicians with some EMT training.

"It's... He is mad..."

You lean in close to Juergens to blot out the other groaning patients. "Wait, you're talking about Dumi, aren't you?"

The man wheezes so hard that you feel your own chest tightening in sympathy pain. "Duminass-7... The ODE system showed me his mind... I saw all of him, his past, his conspiracies, his dreams... I shouldn't have been able to..."

"But weren't you using his own super-computer brain to do that?"

"Nooo... I mean... his mind shouldn't have been enough like mine to understand... He's from a place beyond reality, birthed from raw contempt and hatred, yet his mind has reforged itself... into something almost human..."

"Well... that's good, right?"

"He is a devil, trying to become a man... and angel of destruction trying on a business suit... He is trapped between secret desires of love and understanding, and an impossibly strong urge to upturn this whole planet for one artifact and leave us all to burn. Duminass, in his true form, should be beyond the concept of madness... but he is making himself mad, by stooping to our beastial state... debasing himself, yet clutching to his power and his purpose..."

"You've lost me..."

Juergen wheezes again, and then breaks out in a fit of coughing.

"Er, listen, I have some stuff, wierd technology we cooked up, in my mech, maybe it can help you?"

"*wheeze* The False Cells? *Kaff* Aye, I might live if you used those... but not as a man. I'd be Duminass' puppet, fueled by death and rage, and the tears of humanity... I didn't want to become a murderer... I just wanted... to end the pointless struggles of humanity... The ODE system was a dream for the future... Are you really going to make me into the antithesis of that dream?"

The Transport flies over the outskirts of New Delhi, nothing to differentiate it from any other large-scale flying vessel in the scrum above the sprawling metropolis. Junkers Faction codes running through the transponder absolve the ship of any suspicions the automatic security systems might pin on them. So far, everything seems to be safe.

"We leave them here. All of them."

You sigh. "Not this again, Kai."

"I'm serious. We gain nothing by waiting around here, and we risk the EFA pouncing on us with a surprise inspection at any point. We just deliver them to a sawbones, fly off, and Lily's people can sneak them out later. Problem solved, and we're back on our way to Africa."

"But what if we want to take in the true spirit of India?"

"Then you order some takeaway."

---

"This is good biryani."

"This is the home country, foods always best in its home country."

"Pining for mom's fried noodles, Kai?"

"Fried noodles aren't... Shut up and pass the peshawara."

---

The massive wrecking ball clunks to the ground, sinking several meters into the concrete through sheer mass. Then the rest of the mech follows. The BemiDoban looks out over the Geneva cityscape, drinking in the stioc metallic architecture. The Barshem Squad form up behind him, weapons stowed.

The Defense Gespensts aim their weapons, and Baran's translater picks up and order to identify themselves. Sensible, those primitive slugthrowers won't even tickle our mechs.

"I am General Baran Doban, of the Balmarian Imperial Armed Forces. In the name of Princess Armana and Commander Laodicea, I demand to speak to a member of those whose true name is First and Only. We have much to discuss of the future of both, no, all three of our races."

---

"We should be able to reach them by now..." Vindel taps in another code into the comm unit, but still nothing but static. "There shouldn't be anything stopping a transmission through the Indian Ocean datanodes to the DC's hidden servers... Could the EFA be jamming the signal?"

Kai turns from the controls. "They did use those big jamming satellites of theirs, at TLI and the Earth Cradle... But would if they were, wouldn't we be seeing interference in the upper atmosphere? My radar is clean."

"It's possible the connections have been physically severed, but that would imply EFA troops have moved into Central Africa in force, which given how many operations you said they've mounted recently, seems unfeasible... Lemon, could you track the fault?"

"Right." The calm young woman taps at the controls for a few minutes. "It seems the DCs external routers are online, but they've lost connection to their base. Thats not something that happens by accid... Who said that?"

Vindel raises an eyebrow. "Said what?"

"I... I don't understand, I heard... a girls voice... asking me questions..."

Kai shouts an alarm. "Contact ahead! Single mech, PT-sized. No transponder. Its moving to intercept!"
