# Episode 29

##SRWQ Mission 29: We need someone to update that picture...

In our last episode, our heroes finally finished up with the Balmarian refugees in the Neviim, while Dumi converted himself into DaiDumi. Shuu then teleported them all back to earth, to return the DC troops, and the ODE system and Bartols. Little do they know that not only are they closer to their original objectives than ever before, but a dangerous new threat awaits them in the pit below... 

---

You bring the Raioh to a rest on a hilltop overlooking the dig site. A series of massive craters greets you, a level plain of nearly a square mile, dotted not only with craters, but with massive bulk transports, their radar signature even now almost undetectable. To have gotten enough transport power to fit the Bartols this quickly, the Junkers faction certainly lives up to their reputation as the go-to people for going-to.

But other elements of the digsite stand out to you, in particular, one of the dearest trenches seems to have hit paydirt. This massive construction mech, proudly displaying "Beater Excavation" on its shoulder, are taking away the last scraps of dirt around something... very odd. An excited crowd is gathering around the trench.

You hover down to the pit, placing your feet in two of the few spots where people and equipment aren't. "Hey, Mister, nice robot. Does it need a hand?"

"Well... Gun-Diggers only got one... Tell ya what, grab ahold of that far cable trolley, and see if we can't yank this sucker straight out!"

"Ok!" The two giant mechs grab opposites of the earth-covered shape, and pull on the carefully placed steel cables. A small mountain of earth is dislodged as the thing, easily the size of either mech, comes free, to swing comfortably underneath the Gundiggers oversized work arm.

"Well, he is a beaut and a half, isn't he?"

The thing is definitely feline in form, and made of some kind of... furred metal. You recall your encounter with the Tiger-Grungust, back at TLI, only a week ago but it feels like months.

"Travis to Anzai, Travis to Anzai, the Lion is free. He's completely intact. Get on over here, doc!"

But what draws your attention the most is whats holding the ancient metal device together. The plates of fur-metal seem to be connected by a series of glowing blue pseudopods. Blue, and a few green. Actually, a lot of green, more than there were a second ago. Green, rubbery... and terribly familiar.

"D-dumi! I-I got something I think you should scan..."

*There are a lot of things in this base I should scan, Katina. It's a veritable hive of conspiracy, some of it affecting us directly.*

"Directly like a tentacle raping??"

*...Ah, I see what you're talking about now.*

"Is it the same stuff? Is it one of those aliens?"

*...Yes and no. It looks like a hybrid of some kind, like two similar sets of bio-technology were spliced together somehow. One the things we saw before, the other... more earthly.*

"Ok... has it warned the other aliens?"

*No.*

"Phew!"

*But the snake-like one in the next pit over just did.*

"Shit!!"

*This probably isn't a great time to tell you that I've detected the Zweizergain, is it?*

"SHIT SHIT SHIT!!!"

---

"It's an impressive for something that's thousands of years old, ain't it Dr. Anzai?"

"Sure is Rand... Wait, what's that other mech-"

Yelling obscenities, you grab the Lion-thing by the green ropy tendrils, and start pumping energy into it. Lightning arcs through the thing, along the steel cables holding it, and into the Gundigger itself. You hear Rand screaming in shock and pain, and Eri Anzai yelling at you to stop, but you can't, you've seen what it takes to kill these things.

The Green tendrils spasm, turn black, and turn to ash. The Blue Tendrils begin to glow brightly, and then the thing explodes. The forces knock the Raioh onto its back, crushing several large pieces of industrial equipment as you fall. 

You shake your head to recover from the impact, as Dumi's voice sounds in your ear.

*That was... ill-timed.*

"Shut up! Those things are going to kill us! Get your otherworldly ass in gear!"

*And do what exactly? Try to stop the ODE system I just handed the keys of to Juergen? Pick up the Zweizergain? Or secure our allies, assuming we still have any you wouldn't like to electrocute.*

You lift the Raiohs head. The Lion is currently wrapping itself around the Gundigger, the last of the green biomatter being expelled by a blue energy thats soaking into the construction mech. And all around you, Bartols are turning, and activating their weapons systems. Your seismic sensors are going off, and the comm is ablaze with noise.

"Dumi, get the Zweizergain. HEY EVERYONE!!! GET OUT OF HERE, THE EFA ARE COMING!!! THEY'LL BE SENDING THE CRY WOLVES AND BEOWULF!!!" You leap up and head towards the other trench, the source of the siesmic disturbance. Bartols start to blaze away at you, but not all of them: It seems the ODE system lacks coordination. You ignore the minor damage and charge up your Plasma Leaders and the Lightning Fall system. 

Suddenly the thing bursts from the ground. It's bigger than you expected, easily a hundred meters long. For a second it looks more like a lizard than a snake, then the clawed legs fall away as green tentacles solidify into purple armor, and the thing lashes out.

"THE THINGS YOU'RE DIGGING UP WORK FOR THE EFA!! GET THE FUCK OUT!"

The thing looks like its trying to encircle you. 

"WITH LIGHTNING YE SHALL BE PURIFIED!!!" With a wrenching 360 backflip kick, you boot the snake upside the chin and thump it several meters into the air. Then you grab ahold of it and start pouring on power again.

You realise its taking some time to burn through the things new armor a second too late. Its tail punches through the Raioh's back, and damage sensors in that area go nuts. You think you can smell rotten eggs in the cockpit. 

At least the Bartols have stopped shooting at you. Though that may have to do with the second seismic disturbance you're detecting.

    IT WILL TAKE A FEW SECONDS FOR THE PLASMA LEADERS TO BURN INTO THE THINGS FLESHY INNARDS. YOU'RE FAIRLY SURE IT'LL TAKE IT A FEW SECONDS TO BURROW INTO YOUR FLESHY INNARDS. WHAT SHALL YOU DO?

Where are Shu, Kai, and Kar Wai when we need them?!

They're still going 'WTF??? Did Katina just electrocute that guy?'

You only consulted Dumi on the Einstified Choukijins, no-one else. Thus everyone was equally taken by surprise.

Also you're assuming they were all in their mechs and battle-ready. They were negotiating with the DC over the handover of the Bartols and ODE system, thats not a situations where you react quickly to your teammates beating up passersby and shouting incoherently.

Could we hijack emotions from Bartools and ODE system? Do Machine Cells even work that way?

Dumi said it did, but you didn't ask him the details. You have no idea whether it'd just happen, or if you'd need to do a week-long ritual of blood-sacrifice and naked warpaint dancing.
