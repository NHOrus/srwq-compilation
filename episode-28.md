# Episode 28

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 28: You got sum 'splainin' to do, missy!

Last time, our heroine had a more responsible role, as she directed Dumi to help organise a refugee fleet, negiotiate with the newly awakened Balmarians, and call in support from Earth in the form of the Granzon. But now she faces her most terrifying challenge yet: Explaining exactly what the fuck is happening to her colleagues.

---

"Woah! Awesome work, Shuu! You took out that whole fleet, in, what, two minutes?"

"146 seconds, to be precise. And I'd hardly call 4 EFA ships and PT support a true fleet."

"Still, thats an awful lot of ass-whuppin' in that old can."

"Yes... Ms. Tarask, can I ask you a few things?"

"Eh, sure..."

"Why are the Granzons sensors indicating that asteroid over in the distance is filled with incredibly powerful technology? What is that EFA ship doing with an impossible mechanoid weapon in its landing bay? Why is there an EFA ship there in the first place? What about the DC ship? What is causing all this brainwave resonance in the area about that ship? Oh, and, what IS that odd brain-shaped creature hovering between the two ships?"

"Er..."

"And where's Kar-Wai?"

"Now now, Mr. Kitamura, wait your turn..."

 "Blah-blah"

"Long-sleeping alien refugees, ok."

"Blah-blah"

"Commandeered by Shadow Mirror Agents, alright."

"Blah-blah" 

"Stolen from the aliens along with captured humans, that seems plausible."

"Blah-Blah"

"ODE System, interesting."

"Um... Er... And... Thing.."

"Died heroically fighting off 300 mad alien chainsaw robots and a giant dragon with a fez... I see. Fair enough. And about the brain thing?"

"Weather Balloon."

"Weather Balloon?"

"Weather Balloon."

"In space?"

"It's for measuring space weather."

You're not very good at this whole lying thing, are you Katina?

You set your comms to silent and hiss into your earpiece. "Dumi, help me out here! What am I meant to tell them about you?"

*I'm not sure how lying would have any better an outcome than simply telling the truth. My goals, both personal and those set by my master, aren't going to change. I still want to help you, Katina, even if I have to go over the heads of the Shadow Mirrors and do their jobs for them. The trouble is reconciling all the disparate elements you want to unite. The Shadow Mirrors can be made to trust me again, or at least most of them. The DC may respect my power, but mistrust my origins. The Irregulars are probably going to treat me as an enemy. The Balmarians are unlikely to trust me completely, but have little choice. It's a matter of reconciling what you want with whats possible.*

"But, uh... Maybe..."

*You're hardly out of options, Katina. You can try diplomacy. You can invent a proper lie to explain me. Or you can adjust your expectations, and realise you may have to give up some of the things you want.*

You hash out some details with Dumi, and switch back on the comms. "Er, Shuu?"

Shuu turns from his large bank of scanners. "Hmm?"

"Well, ok, the truth is... Dumi sorta found some wierd crystal in the alien ship, the stuff they were using on thier biggest robots, and he sorta... actually, I sorta told him to eat it, to see if it'd power him up like the Machine Cells. And it just sorta... made him blow up like a balloon."

*If I had more emotional links to my appearence, I imagine I'd be incredibly embarressed.*

"I see... So Dumi, can you still function? Are you capable of returning to Earth with us."

*I beleive so... However, a more suitable form is probably a good idea. I shall attempt to manipulate my body to a new shape, so I will be less noticable.*

The red-orange thing tucks in its wings, and starts to shift into a new shape...

---

Shuu's eyes go wide. "Quite extraordinary..."

"Awesome, Dumi!!!"

*This new form should have all the support features of the DGG-04 and many more besides. I think you'll appreciate it, Katina. Now, we have to finish up here and return to Earth to speak with the others.*

"Right."

*I've saved some samples of the crystal that forms the core of the Judecca, no doubt you'll be interested in those, Dr. Shirakawa.*

"Indeed."

*All that remains is to return the Judecca, and provide them with someone with these 'Psychodriver' abilities that it apparently needs. There's really only one candidate: Ms Hackman.*

---

You re-enter the Peregrines medical bay, passing Kai and Kar-Wai catching up on old time. Kai seems genuinely amazed, and for the first time you can remember, is smiling broadly.

You find Patricia just having finished dressing. You curse under your breath. "Pat, we're ready to send you back to the Neviim. You'll be taking their big mech back, to seal the deal between us and them."

"Yeah... Hopefully that'll turn out better than it has so far."

"I only blew it up a little!"

"Well, I hope your people can make this work, Katina, I wouldn't want to end up your enemy again."

"Wh-why would you say such a thing? We're going to save the earth together, Pat."

"I am going to save Earth and the Balmar survivors, I appreciate the help, but the PTX team taught me to be self-reliant. Oh, and I don't recall giving you permission to call me 'Pat'."

You watch as she walks off to the Hangar. "What a bitch!"

*I don't think its as simple as a clash of personalities, Katina. Remember, she's a Psychodriver and you're an... Anti-Psychodriver. Just looking at you probably gives her headache from the mental feedback.*

"...Naw, I'm sticking with 'bitch'." 

---

Patricia Hackman climbs into the cockpit of the Judecca, and relaxes as silver cables emerge from the cieling and wrap around her limbs. It's just a different version of the T-Link System, Pat. You can handle your Gespenst, you can handle this.

The Scorpion-like giant emerges from the Eurydice's hangar, and transforms to humanoid mode. It steadily advances on the Neviim, and images of the alien fortresses system dance inside Pats head.

All this feedback is freaky... Damn, Katina's people really did a number on us. I sure hope Laodicea's in a forgiving mood, we certainly don't need another battle like th-"

*And whoooo do we have here then? You're not Torah's pet human.*

"!!!"

*Oh I remember now, that half-baked sample that Armana had rescued from the scrap-heap. Far from an ideal tool, but then, I get so little material to work with these days...*

"Ugh...Get out...of my head..."

*I'm afraid I can't allow Laodicea to run around on his own anymore, my dear. That noble idiot will run what's left of the Empire into the ground if I leave it up to him. No, I'm afraid I'll have to take over for my little 'brother', and you'll have to help me.*

"Nooo....Agghkkkk...."

*Nothing I can do about this, I'm afraid. Blame that Torah girl for being so idiotically self-sacrificing...*

---

The Judecca re-enters the Asteroid, and another mech emerges to join you, of the same design to the ones you captured earlier. "My name is Bet Barshem, I will be the liaison between Shadow Mirror and the Neviim."

"Awesome. Ok Shuu, take us back to Africa, I gotta lot of catching up t-"

*I'm afraid not, Katina. Part of the deal I made with the Junkers Faction is that we deliver the DC survivors and the ODE system to them first. And hand over some of our samples of alien tech.*

"Aw man, are we ever gonna get home at this rate?"

*We've been gone less that 48 hours. And you've never actually been to that base.*

"I meant home in the 'within glomping range of Arado and Latooni' sense."

*...I see.*

 With a pop, a small section of sky is replaced with a similar section of space, and a large group of vehicles appears from the void.

The Granzon lands heavily, fighting to maintain balance. "Uurgh....Teleporting so many units at once...I thought the Granzon could handle it better, but there were instabilities."

That may have been due to my presence, apologies.

"I see..."

You set the Raioh down and look about you. "Wait, where are we again?"

Nothern China, a nuetral location where we can hand over the Peregrine and the Bartols to the Junkers Faction without EFA involvement. I'm detecting a Rhinoceros and several mechs in the vicinity of some form of digging site.

"Wait, we're giving up the Bartols? Like, all 200 of them?"

287, actually, and the Junkers Faction would be mad to surrender them to us.

"So would we! We need mechs too!"

You have me, don't you?

"I guess...Hey, is that a Simurgh??"

Besides, this means we get to beat Hackman down later on.

And hey, maybe Lowdecker or WARE KUSO WA BARAN DOBAN will notice somethings up and nip it in the bud.

I'm not sure... At any rate, both @!Euzeth and OG!Euzeth seem to have some way of communicating and/or sharing information between universes, since both of them are aware of what is going on when Ingram's soul enters into their universes's Alef Barshem.

Well, considering that the Barshem series are all clones of Ingram, I'm willing to bet that Ingram's shown up at some point or another in every universe where the Ze Balmary Empire exists.

Of course, I may just be grasping at straws. Its a very scary thought that all Euzeths may somehow be in contact with each other in some sort of interdimensional network of evil and jackassery...

So have some batshit nightmare Katina instead.

 Manami Hamill lowers her binoculars. "So, Miss Junkers, it seems you've assembled quite a force here. If you can get it back to your home base undetected, you'll be a powerful force on this continent."

Lily simply sighs, with a pained look on her face. "It was meant to be so much more...A force to help free the colonies in one swoop. And now Vindel's goons have ruined it all!"

"Heh. I've heard that one before. In our line of word, Ms. Junkers, we can't afford to mope about our setbacks. We simply have to make do with what we get."

"Or dig out of the earth, in some cases."

"That too...although ancient mechanoids from thousands of years in the past are no wierder than an asteroid full of sleeping aliens."

"Do you truly beleive these Mechanoids will be enough for your ELF to rebound from the rest of Vindel's meddling?"

"This is hardly my only project, Ms Junkers. Rest assured, I'll be making sure Vindel pays us back for any inconvenience he may have caused us before."
