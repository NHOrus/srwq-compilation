 Last time, our heroine had a more responsible role, as she directed Dumi to help organise a refugee fleet, negiotiate with the newly awakened Balmarians, and call in support from Earth in the form of the Granzon. But now she faces her most terrifying challenge yet: Explaining exactly what the fuck is happening to her colleagues. Anonymous Sat 27 Feb 2010 04:54:44 No.4603472 Report

 "Woah! Awesome work, Shuu! You took out that whole fleet, in, what, two minutes?"

"146 seconds, to be precise. And I'd hardly call 4 EFA ships and PT support a true fleet."

"Still, thats an awful lot of ass-whuppin' in that old can."

"Yes...Ms. Tarask, can I ask you a few things?"

"Eh, sure..."

"Why are the Granzons sensors indicating that asteroid over in the distance is filled with incredibly powerful technology? What is that EFA ship doing with an impossible mechanoid weapon in its landing bay? Why is there an EFA ship there in the first place? What about the DC ship? What is causing all this brainwave resonance in the area about that ship? Oh, and, what IS that odd brain-shaped creature hovering between the two ships?"

"Er..."

"And where's Kar-Wai?"

"Now now, Mr. Kitamura, wait your turn..."

WHAT SHALL KATINA ANSWER FIRST?

Tsubaki also is a Cosmic Horror that teaches other Cosmic Horrors about the nature of life and death.

"In space?"

"It's for measuring space weather."

You're not very good at this whole lying thing, are you Katina?

You set your comms to silent and hiss into your earpiece. "Dumi, help me out here! What am I meant to tell them about you?"

I'm not sure how lying would have any better an outcome than simply telling the truth. My goals, both personal and those set by my master, aren't going to change. I still want to help you, Katina, even if I have to go over the heads of the Shadow Mirrors and do their jobs for them. The trouble is reconciling all the disparate elements you want to unite. The Shadow Mirrors can be made to trust me again, or at least most of them. The DC may respect my power, but mistrust my origins. The Irregulars are probably going to treat me as an enemy. The Balmarians are unlikely to trust me completely, but have little choice. It's a matter of reconciling what you want with whats possible.

"But, uh...Maybe..."

You're hardly out of options, Katina. You can try diplomacy. You can invent a proper lie to explain me. Or you can adjust your expectations, and realise you may have to give up some of the things you want.

WHAT SHALL WE DO? I'd like more thought-out answers on any fibs we're going to be telling, or other coverup strategies.

Anyway, this is my viable choice: use Dumi and our common objective of tumbling the EFA as a way to unite the DC, the SM and the Balmars, and try to keep Dumi a secret to the invaders. We just have to keep Dumi a secret from everyone related to the irregulars and wait till they find their thingamagic and they go to their dimensions. 

This does have the risk of one of the irregulars in our base finding out about Dumi and try to communicate with their allies, forcing us to fight and possibly kill them.

Surely, you must be thinking that this is crazy. That fighting against our heroes is a dumb thing, but then again, what good have they done to us in all this time? Have they given us supprt? Weaponry? Done anything other than killing-off many Shadow Mirrors and doing absolutely nothing but look for Vindel? Anything other than sending spies and conspiring for ways to kill us in case we do something they don't want? 

Of course, this only comes in as a worst case scenario. We just have to transform Dumi into a little girl so the irregulars and the grunts of each side don't suspect in him.


IN SHORT: Reveal Dumi to the higher ups of each faction and make them keep it a secret from the irregulars and general civilians and grunts that we have Dumi on our side.

 Tell the truth, partially.

Say that Dumi was being used against its will as part of the ODE system after an accidental run in the Balmar. And now it wants to help you out in return for saving it. Just don't bring up the whole "Built by evil brain" thing

 You hash out some details with Dumi, and switch back on the comms. "Er, Shuu?"

Shuu turns from his large bank of scanners. "Hmm?"

"Well, ok, the truth is...Dumi sorta found some wierd crystal in the alien ship, the stuff they were using on thier biggest robots, and he sorta...actually, I sorta told him to eat it, to see if it'd power him up like the Machine Cells. And it just sorta...made him blow up like a balloon."

If I had more emotional links to my appearence, I imagine I'd be incredibly embarressed.

"I see...So Dumi, can you still function? Are you capable of returning to Earth with us."

I beleive so...However, a more suitable form is probably a good idea. I shall attempt to manipulate my body to a new shape, so I will be less noticable.

The red-orange thing tucks in its wings, and starts to shift into a new shape...

CHOOSE DUMIS NEW FORM

Mass conversion to at least the correct order of magnitude is needed, so Dumi can go between a large robot or a small ship in size. In the region of 50-100m is what I'm looking at (Since I'm assuming he's a comparable size to the Judecca he fought).

Let's have the ship as it's base form, and let's have it transform in many other things when it is necessary.

All of these options are good, but what use would Dumi be when not in battle if he is locked in Gun/mech form by default? Better have it as a transport, and then have it transform during battles.

"I am going to save Earth and the Balmar survivors, I appreciate the help, but the PTX team taught me to be self-reliant. Oh, and I don't recall giving you permission to call me 'Pat'."

You watch as she walks off to the Hangar. "What a bitch!"

I don't think its as simple as a clash of personalities, Katina. Remember, she's a Psychodriver and you're an...Anti-Psychodriver. Just looking at you probably gives her headache from the mental feedback.

Well, considering that the Barshem series are all clones of Ingram, I'm willing to bet that Ingram's shown up at some point or another in every universe where the Ze Balmary Empire exists.

Of course, I may just be grasping at straws. Its a very scary thought that all Euzeths may somehow be in contact with each other in some sort of interdimensional network of evil and jackassery...

 Great, more conspiracies going on... Stealthboy, update the chart...

See, this is why I said we don't want to "rescue" Vindel yet. He wouldn't add anything to our efforts, and he's probably better off where he is.

How about we give Lat the Katina Custom and give her a pair of wingmen in normal Valkyrlions?

Lat is a melee pilot, so it makes sense.

Katina's custom type Valkyrlion.
Plasma stakes replacing the Sonic Drivers, and a handheld version of Ganduro's Sheath Anchor instead of the Burst Railgun.

Sell, since she shows the ability to control multiple mechs at once with the Fairlions, how about we slave the other Valkyrs to the Custom unit? Sort of like full-blown mecha Funnels?

Valkyrlions W and V are also both equipped with the W-I3NK system like the Fairlions, allowing Valkyrlion V to act as the control unit.

Why not create another version of the Valkyrlion, Wodinlion or something, and give it to Kar-Wai?
