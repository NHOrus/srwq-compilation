# Episode 41

##SRWQ Mission 41: Let's do the Time Dive again

In our last episode, our heroine Katina Tarask got her clothes back on and decided to start recruiting for her trip to another world, to get away from the megalomaniacal Vindel Mauser. Her recruitment drive met with only partial success, as Seolla and Latooni both held out, wanting more from the trip than vague promises of freedom. Although a fair few recruits were found, the logistics involved in getting everyone mechs soon became harrowingly difficult. Desperate for more people and and potentially seeking an excuse to call in the cavalry, the group sets forward a dangerous proposal...

---

Vindel frowns at the datapad. "Operation Lygeus Revival?"

Sophia Nate nods. "It's become clear to me, given your current military plans, that it will soon be impossible for my research to develop further. You require my perfected machine cells, but cannot give me the oppurtunity to create them. Further, the Shadow Mirror needs a secure location in a place where Project SRX cannot keep tabs on them."

"You chose an inconvenient time to give me this plan, three hours before the deadline..."

"The Duminass entity claims it can transport us as soon as we complete the transfer of men and equipment."

"Really? And do you honestly think we can spare the men and equipment at this point?"

"Look at my suggested personnel list, Colonel. Many of these people are dead weight to your current plan. Your wounded, your insubordinate, people who joined on a whim after the TLI incident. People you're frankly better off without, but who I can deal with on a non-military level to construct your offworld base, easily."

Vindel scrolls through the list of names again. "Kazahara as overall commander. Trustworthy man, currently injured... Hmm... You've thought this out better than I expected, given how hard we've been working you."

"The machine cell augmentations make it easier for me to multitask, Colonel."

"Right..."

Vindel puts down the datapad and steeples his finger. "My main objection, in that case, would be this mech requisition list. Do you seriously expect me to give you both the Grungust Type-3 and the DGG-03, on the eve of such an important combat mission? And the technological potential of the Vanishing Trooper?"

Sophias face darkens. "I will need protection in any world we find. You know as well as I, conflict is inevitable in any universe. And you cannot repair the Huckebien with your current technological base, only the true Machine Cells can do it."

"Valid points, certainly. But I cannot give you this much, not when we need it as well. You'll have to reduce this list drastically before I can consider it. And, of course, one other thing..."

"What?"

"I'll need a way to keep tabs on you. I'd be insane to just let you leave without any way of finding out exactly what you're doing."

---

*That will be an issue. Not an insurmountable one, but an issue nonetheless.*

You look questioningly at Dumi. "I thought you talked between dimensions all the time, Dumi."

*Far from it. If I could, Dark Brain would be able to talk to me at will. In fact, if you can send communications that easily to other universes, its a trivial step to be able to scan them from outside, and remote searcher units like myself would not be needed. Almost all interdimensional communication is done by courier.*

"So, we need a courier. Wait, that'd be you, wouldn't it?"

*With a daily update schedle, I'd have to cross the dimensional boundaries every 24 hours. I'd constantly be fighting my way through the storm, which would be a significant and draining trip to do once. The chances of something going wrong would be significant, and I would be incredibly low on power and useful time in either world.*

"So we'd need some other way..."

*If we can get another interdimensional unit, I can set up a transdimensional lock to it, and use it to pick up particle pulses that can act as a radio. Not reliable in the Storm, but it'll be enough fot Vindel. However, currently, there are only 2 dimensional units we know of, and 2 contacts on my dimensional sensors which might work. The XN Giest and the Zweizergain are both in Irregular hands. The signal from Izu base is... well, it involves going into the belly of the beast. And the final signal is in space, ehading towards earth.*

"Oh man, those aren't good options, any of them..."

*And we have three hours to implement them. Either that, or we're calling in the Balmarians and making a break for it.*

---
```
WHAT WILL OUR HEROINE DO?

Other issues:

You still haven't talked to Shuu.

You got Sophia to sneak Latooni onto the personnel list, but this still leaves Seolla. While getting her aboard the Eurydice stealthily wouldn't be hard, she's currently not going willingly. You'd essentially have to kidnap her if you're taking her. And if you're not taking her, you need to hash things out with Arado...

Mech Requisition: Vindel will allow you to take Thrudgelmir and Bergelmir as a concession to Magus, but any other mechs would have a hard time being approved. You could cajole the Raioh out of them, but nothing else. Taking the hulks of the Soulgain and the Huckebien, but that'd be it. Or you could just take 5 grunt mechs, or 3 Machine-cell augmented grunts. Other combinations may be possible, but the Thrud and the Berg take up a lot of your kudos (The Bergelmir is not negotiable, Dumi isn't going anywhere without Tis).

There are no issues with taking the Eurydice though. You may have to take a few faceless grunts along though.
```

"So, you can't build a stargate or something to do the work for us."

*Crossgates aren't something you can just whip up. I could potentially make one, but I'd need help, and I certainly couldn't do it in three hours.*

"And what about the Irregulars?"

*I suppose it might be possible they'd allow us some level of dimensional tech, if we helped them get back to their dimension, but the issue is, they have something I need. I need the Compatible Kaiser before we leave this dimension proper. If Dark Brain were ever to find out I was in the same dimension as it, and didn't claim it for him, my life, and likely all of yours as well, would be forfeit.*

"So, Shuu then..."

---

You find Shuu near the DC bunker, searching through a large block of indescribable technology. He's pulling out all forms of arcane devices, as Aquija looks on with an amazed expression on her face.

"Hey Shuu... Doing science in capital letters again?"

"I am investigating the contents of this fabrication device recovered from the Inspectors after their defeat. It shows signs of extreme lack of maintenance due to overuse from Vat Tran, but it could be a valuable tool if fully repaired."

"Right... Uh, could you, the Scientific Defender of Earth and all, use it to... talk between dimensions? We're sort of coming up with a plan at the moment, to take a short trip, and..."

Shuu looks up at you, a quizzical face showing through his glasses, then he turns to one particular collection of green tubes and silvery lumps of glowing lights. "Have you forgotten, Ms. Tarask? Soon after you met Vat Tran, you asked him to have Aquija create a dimensional scanner for you. This machine has been working on it since, and it appears mostly complete. I would have to modify, using similar principles to the Granzon's dimensional shielding, but if your friend Duminass can come up with some form of code, spelt out by transferring particles between worlds, then theres no theoretical reason this scanner cannot detect the transmission."

"Oh thank you!" You hug Shuu hard, taking him a little by surprise. "You've saved us, Shuu."

"Well, that's my job. Um, Ms Tarask... might I ask how long you intend to be gone for?"

You unhug Shuu and look up at him. "Er, well, we were going to go set up a base, and help Sophia finish her proper Machine Cells... A few weeks, at least, maybe some months?"

Shuu nods. "I would say... to take your time. And when you return, be ready for things to be different. I, Shuu Shirakawa, have pledged to save Earth and secure the future of humanity, and once I have secured my plans, a period of months should be sufficient to complete my task. Once you return, things will be different, this world will be something worth returning to."

---

Shuu watches Katina walk off, then jumps as his phone starts ringing. He spends over a minute searching through pockets he'd forgotten he'd had to find.

"Who is this? How did you get my number?"

*Dr Shirakawa, I have a message for you.*

"Duminass.. .what are you playing at this time?"

*I still don't know exactly what you're up to, but since you're helping Katina, I'll give you fair warning. The Retribution is coming sooner than you think. Be ready to go back onto your own path in the near future.*

"...I am ready. I've been ready since the day I designed the Granzon. Nothing will stand in my way."

*Acknowledged. We will keep Ring safe. And I hope that this world you're planning to make is one that Katina can live in.*

"...Justice will prevail. That's all I will say."

---

Sophia frowns at you. "Leave Wodan? I... I can't do that! The man needs me, Katina. His brain damage, fractured memories and other issue make him highly unstable in his current state. I can't simply abandon him!"

"But... Vindel won't let us take the Raioh unless we leave the Thrudgelmir behind! And I really want it and the Rapist-Cage..."

"Katina, I don't think you'r-"

"And the Huckebien, since I don't trust Vindel with black holes, and Axel needs his Soulgain, and Lamia her Angelg, and I'd really like that Ashsaber, an-"

*Katina, I really think you need to prioritise a little here. I can understand the desire for firepower, as much for ourselves as to deny it to Vindel. But we need this to go smoothly as possible for the initial period, at least. If you really must have certain mechs, we still need to choose a reasonable loadout at first, so that we can get all the wounded away from the Shadow Mirrors first and foremost. Then, perhaps we can join up with the Balmarians, and go back for the rest. But right now, to make this work, you need to pick an initial list.*

---

HERES HOW IT IS.

You have 10 points to spend (Would be 12, but non-negotiable Bergelmir). Different units cost different amounts.

Gespenst/Lion Series/Randgrith: 1
Machine-celled Gespenst/Lion/Randgrith: 2
Busted Soulgain: 3
Angelg: 4
Thrudgelmir: 5
Raioh: 5
Rapiecage: 4
Trashed Huckebien: 3
Rathgrith: 2
R-Blade: 2
Ezekiels: 2 (But only Kar-Wai, Bet Barshem, Tytti and Radha can use them. Bet's willing to dump hers to make room)
Gespenst SALIENT: 3
Mironga: 2
Assault Lander: 3
Hyperlion: 4, 2 for each of the two pieces.

>How does Dumi feel about leaving Raioh?

*If it's used in a professional and controlled manner, as a silver bullet rather than a frontline mech, then perhaps it won't be too bad, at least compared to a standard mech. So long as you're not ranting across the comms and spreading fear of the Thunderous Fury, it would be subsumed in the more general mass of dread the Shadow Mirrors generate as a whole. There's a chance of things going horribly wrong, but it would be a more general thing of the entire allotment of Shadow Mirror Cells mutating as one, rather than the Raioh alone.*

"Th-that doesn't make me feel any better about it!!"

*I'd better not get a job as a promotional speaker then...*

---

The Thrudgelmir has to stoop as it enters the cramped mech-bay of the Eurydice, but it makes its way to the rear and sits down as the Bergelmir and R-Blade enter, carrying the wrecked remnants of the Huckebien EX. The R-Blade turns as you look back at the Trilobite, and the Raioh you're leaving for the wolves.

*Strap everything in, we have 57 minutes to get underway.*


Kusuha quickly checks off the patients as they are wheeled into the Eurydices snug medbay. "Ohara, Watson, Kazahara... That seems to be it, so strap everyone... Wait, who?" She looks up as the straggler is wheeled in.

"I-it's you!!"

Arado looks up at the girl he rescued from the cyborgs. "Ah, the fainting girl. How have you been since?"

"Er... Ok." She points down at the silver-haired girl on the trolley. "Who's this?"

"Petty Sergeant Nila Obody. She was locked in a confined room when some sort of fumes knocked her out. Since you'd all moved into this ship, I felt she needed to be here too."

"B-but... This ship is going to be going to another dimension! If you bring her here, she'll be stuck with us as her only allies for months!"

"Really... maybe that'll do her some good." Arado wheels the trolley past Kusuha and into the medbay.

---

"I didn't think you capable of this kind of manipulation, Tarask." Latooni sits at the tactical station on the Eurydice's bridge, while you plop yourself down at the sensors. "I'm almost impressed. If I didn't think Dumi was mainly responsible, I'd almost think you'd learnt something these past two weeks."

"If I give you the R-Blade, will that shut you up?"

"No. The current pilot allotment means either you or Axel should pilot that unit. I'll remain on the bridge until we procure an appropriate unit."

*All hands, this is your support vessel. Dumi floats past the window, once again in ship form. We will initially be making a short jump to another location on this world to test our systems. Soon after, we will me making our final jump. Everyone, do your duty. This is all for the dream of freedom on Earth.*

The Eurydice flies in behind the sleek black shape as they both pick up speed. A wave of uncolour breaks off Dumi's bow, then forms a bubble about both ships, and in a snap, they're gone.

---

Vindel turns from the Trilobite viewscreen to Lemon, pinching the bridge of her nose in the corner. "Will you be alright?"

"I... I'll live. I'd rather he'd stayed, but even without his memories, he's too damned suttborn to listen. And the Machine Cells are still the best hope for fixing his memory, even after the disaster with W-43."

"Right." Vindel turns to the commscreen and keys in the code he'd been given. "19 minutes to the deadline. Lets not delay any longer."

For a few nerve-wracking minutes the screen shows nothing but static and firewall block announcement, but after 14 seperate codes, the screen resolves to show Yukiko Date's office. She sits as she did in the video, hands clasped in front of her face, eyes hidden by the glare in her glasses. "Colonel Mauser. I trust you've thought long and hard about my proposal."

"I have, Director. I have consulted with all my inner staff and with my allies in the DC. We are all agreed. Working with you to rid the world of this blight of aliens is the only course open to us. We will work with you."

Date grins, broadly yet coldly. "I can see why you've been as successful as you have, Colonel. I'll send you locations for rendevous point, there we can get you hidden and equipped, and return your captive crewmen, and from there, I can organise for you to meet me and pla-"

The explosions rattle against the Trilobites viewscreen like rain. Vindel snaps towards the sensors officer. "What's happening? Who is attacking?!"

"Sir, I'm picking up several hundred small mechanised units... They appeared using some from of teleportation! Patterns are consistent with the data from the Raioh, they're AGX-01s!"

Vindel stares at the battle unfolding in front of him. "The Balmarians..."

###SRWQ Special Mission: Baranquest

You are Baran Doban, royal guard of the Princess Armana, currently operating as combat commander of the Aerogater forces of the Neviim. With help from your agent Bet Barshem, you've coordinated an attack on the united forces of the Shadow Mirrors and Divine Crusaders, dissident groups opposed to the planets proper government. Commander Laodicea has determined that their threat must end, so that the pro-alien factions on the planet become strong enough to allow the Balmarian survivors to settle on Earth

You have at your command 420... no, a bunch of the dumb things got themselves destroyed by static defenses... 392 Megillots, 35 Zecheriah drones, 5 Ezekiels piloted by Barshem clones, Luria in her Shemuel, and your Bemidoban, pride artefact of your family line. Your data on the targets in incomplete, but Bet Barshem has identified which pilots are of note. The Aerogater mechs are equipped with capture devices, so that these valuable individuals can be saved, and bloodshed minimised.

You're not entirely happy with this mission, but really, compared to the other options, doing the EFAs dirty work for them isn't the worst of options. And if you can turn some of these warriors to the Balmar side, without resorting to that disgusting Judecca thing, you can build up your retinue once again. All these Barshem clones are starting to creep you out...

Hundreds of Megillots swarm over the DC lines, lasers striking out at the hastily-deployed mecha. The barest scraps of Vat Tran and Junkers forces, they hold out only for a minute or two, taking a few dozen of the things with them. Even with DC engineering, enhanced with scraps of Inspector technology, theres only so much fight in the delapidated units.

The next defense line is much tougher, The hulk of the DCs last Rhinoceros, battered and buckled but still able to shoot, launches the Valkyria Squads, two dozen things that were once Lions but were now long-legged, four-winged silvery mechs that outperformed their predecessors in every way. From the central runways launched the name number of Svartalfs, altered Gespensts, grown large and wide, armored yet surprisingly fast. The Megillots fought on, but suddenly, their numbers were the only thing that made this a fight.

Baran frowns at this. His sensors show more mechs, emerging from the Trilobite itself, but none of the designated Samples, yet. "Luria, take the Zecheriahs in to engage these new units. Barshems, support us from range."

The 5 suits begin to attack, beam lancing out at the new units. One Valkyria dodges one beam only to fly into another and tumbles from the sky. Not enough...

"Curse Laodicea, why couldn't he give us the Haggais I wanted?"

Luria answers. "The Aerogaters weren't equipped with Habbai units, and many of their Habbakuks were recycled by the humans to make their drones."

"Then we'll have to concentrate on close combat." The Bemidoban quivers as a viable target appears onscreen, a large orange mecha with black stripes, with one of the lost Ezekiels emerging with it. "Finally..."

The Bemidoban's thrusters kick in, thrusting it across the waste ground at a speed that belies its bulk. It crashes through the enemy lines, one Svartalf being almost turned to paste on its hammer. It crashes down in front of the two mechs, digging a massive furrow as it skids to a stop.

"That's our mech, human! We'll be taking it back now!"

The Ezekiel turns, drawing and unfolding its cannon. "Not on my watch, Balmar! You aliens won't be getting your way anymore!!"

An ID flashes up on Baran's screen. "Galuin! You've been made a sample before, you know that if we had malevolent designs, we can be much nastier than we have been. Just surrender and-"

The bolt of energy digs into the Bemidoban's chest, and Baran barely swings up his hammer in time to block the seconds. "I'm not Galuin!! I am Kar-Wai, and I will lead the Aggressors to defend this earth!"

The Gunleons chainsaws dig into the Bemi's flanks, before Rand ducks back from the swinging hammer. As Baran prepares for a counterstroke, another mech flies out of the hangar, its plasma stakes delivering a stinging punch to the side. The Bemidoban is forced back several steps.

Kai grunts. "I might not be a fan of alien tech, but they improved the sluggish ol' type S a fair bit. Even with half the system bitching at me in gibberish, its still handling like a dream."

"More theft!" Baran recovers his footing and swings his hammer as a shield. "That mech shows what can happen if our races work together, but you Shadow Mirrors prevent all that. Renounce these short-sighted ideals and stand down!"

The grey Gespenst drops into a fighting stance. "Not gonna happen, lardass."

"Wh-what did you call me? Impudent human! How dare you mock the Doban family physique?!" The swinging hammer flies up into the air, and is then dragged down towards the tarmac. Kai jumps out of the way, but is buffeted by the overpressure, as massive chunks of concrete are torn up.

"Darling, that's you chance!"

"I know what I'm doing, Mail!"

The Gunleon swoops down and digs its chainsaw blades into the hammers chain. The two blades spark furiously as they attempt to sever the chain.

"You mock my family and its Bemidoban with such simple strategies, human!" Baran engages his shoulder engines and yanks back on the chain. The teeth of the chainsaws snap under the stress, and the giant ball rams into the Gunleons back sending it tumbling to the earth.

"Kai, cover Rand!"

"Right!" The twin energy beams lance out of the alien mechs, striking hard at the Bemi's upper torso and sending it back.

"This'd be the point were Hawker would fly in and stab him in the back..."

"Don't get nostalgic now, Lau!"

The hammer begins to swing again. "Kar-Wai Lau! Kai Kitamura! I don't want to slay you here, but if you truly insist, I'll show you the Balmar resolve to live!"

The Aggressors only response is to pick up a massive metal implement at their feet, and toss it forward.

Rand catches the Giant Wrench, and swings it around his head, aping Baran. "Get off your high horse, man! The point of a fight is for two guys to compare their tools. Now, does yours really match up?"

"HAHAHAHA! How laughable! My one ball will match up to your two any day!"

The two massive weapons collide. The sonic boom reverberates across the battlefield, sending loose rubble flying. The two swing around, and theres a second massive impact, then a third. The earth shakes as the two titans collide.

"You may have a big ball... but I ain't feeling it!"

"HAHAHAHA!! Well, maybe you'll feel this!!"

The Bemidoban boosts backwards, and its shoulder engines ignite to full drive. The entire torso begins to revolve at fantastic speeds, the wind kicked up enough to send boulders flying. In response, the caterpillar tracks on the Gunleon also begin to spin, and it charges at the Bemidoban as it turns into a tornado of its own.

Impact.

The nearby Megillots and Svartalfs are buffeted by the shockwave, as the force of thousands of tons of explosive emanate from one weapon blow. Several crash into each other, raining down onto the battlefield as flaming wreckage, a battlefield blasted clean by the shockwave.

The giant wrench bounces off the top of Trilobite 1, followed soon after by the Gunleon. Both land on the tarmac below, as Rand stuggles to get his tortured mech to stand again. Gunleon growls from the pain.

The Bemidoban is dragged back several hundred meters by its own hammer, the arms servoes strained to their limit. He skids to a stop at the edge of the base, the hammer thudding hard into the ground.

"Baran, if you're done showing off, I could use a littlAGH!!" Luria twists to prevent the Vaisagas blade digging further into her torso. As she boosts away, the Rapiecage swings the blade two-handed over its head, and enters a fighting stance once more.

"A true warrior does not ask for help, alien. She stands her ground and finishes her duel!!"

Baran looks back at Kai and Kar-Wai advancing again, then up at Brooklyn Luckfields new unit.

The Rapiecage jinks back as Baran swings his hammer at its maximum length. It clips the Ezekiel and forces Kai to duck under it. "I will have your attention, earthlings! I will make you fools listen, if I have to thrash you till your ears burst!"

"I'm getting mighty sick of your grandstanding, fatso!" Kai jumps out of the rolling dive, boosts upward, and flips.

"ULTIMATE GESPENST KICK!!"

The foot lands squarely in the Bemidobans chest, and sends it flying back. It takes all of Barans experience flying it to keep it on its feet. Then the shells start raining down.

"How rude sir! How presumptous! Suggesting a three-on-one duel." The Over-Oxtongue Launcher switches to energy mode, and a swathe of blue flame blackens the ground about the Bemidoban.

Kai lands, and opens up his chest blaster once more, but turns away when he hears the strangled cry.

Kar-Wai's mech is cover in Megillots, and damaged as it is by the glancing blow from the hammer, it lacks the strength to knock them all off. Kar-Wai grabs one and puts his foot through it, but another two attack his back. Two different energy beams ignite as Kar-Wai yells again.

Kai leaps in and clotheslines one of the Megillots, then impaling it on his plasma stakes. He turns back and see the other boosting skyward, a ring of green energy clasped in its mandibles. It reaches above the battle space, and fades in a brief burst of energy.

The Ezekial cockpit has been torn open from behind. Theres no sign of a pilot.

The Oxtongue Launcher flies away as the Doban Hammer flies in another arc. Ducking low, Brooklyn draws the Vaisagas Blade again, and cuts at the chain. This time, it leaves a mark.

The Chain is yanked away from the Rapiecage as the Barshem series begin supporting fire, making the space betwen Brooklyn and Doban a web of energy beam. With the momentary distraction, Baran boosts away, towards the alien-build Gespensts which is smashing through a cloud of Megillots towards him.

"What have you done to him!!"

"Kar-Wai be stored aboard the Neviim until the Balmarian nation is secured. So will all of you, unless you cooperate!"

"I don't cooperate with anyone who abducts people, human or alien!"

The Gespenst Punch twists inside the hammer and knocks it aside as it charges. Then, at point-blank-range, the blaster empties into the right shoulder engine of the BemiDoban, which pops with a bloom of red flame.

Kai is wrenched in his seat as Baran grabs his leg with the free arm, and throws the Gespenst into one of its machine-celled cousins, knocking both into a stray Megillot, which promptly crumples.

"An interesting manuver, human, you've actually managed to damage the Bemidoban. I would offer you a place on my retinue, but I don't think you're going to come quietly."

Kai picks himself up. "I'm not the quiet type..."

"What is it you want, Earthling? We Balmarians cannot leave this dissident army be, our future depends on it, but I have no wish to slay proud warriors needlessly. Why can't yo-"

"We're from different factions, different nations. We have opposing goals, and the only way to enforce them is in battle." The Gespenst charges up its weapons again as a pack of Megillots surround it and the Svartalf. "That just happens from time to time. It's how the world work. Sitting there bitching about it won't get you anywhere!"

Baran doesn't respond immediately, as across the battlefield, away from the worst of the fighting, a large unwieldy transport is lifting off, escorted by a feminine winged mech and 3 black mechs, the type designed in the Neviim.

"I am far from ignorant of politics, Kai Kitamura. I was one of the royal guards of the Balmarian court, in the thick of the cut and thrust of the Empires machinations. But at heart I'm a warrior, and I think in warriors terms. Thus, my heart yearns for simple combat, between equals. I offer this to you now: A duel between myself and the Champion of the Shadow Mirrors, to prevent any more loss of men and material, for the battles yet to come."

Kai snorts. "Bwahahaha! You're too nice for this business, Mr Doban! You want to fight, not to win. That's noble and all...but on the battlefield it'll get you killed!"

"Don't you dare mock my resolve! I'll smear across this crumbling facade if I have to!"

"Then you should have done it first chance you got. Now its too late."

"It's never too late for a Doban to turn the tide! Watch, human, as I crush your ships an-" The lightning crackles about the Bemidoban, and, somehow, lifts it into the air, dragging it backwards, into the outstretched foot. Something cracks.

Baran pulls the Bemi off the ground and drags up his hammer, as the Raioh advances, glowing red with plasma.

"Target still active. Continuing attack."

Echidna Iasaki sends the super robot flying at the Bemidoban, feet aflame.

WHAT WILL BARAN DO?

Echidna's not suited to SR fighting, so the advantage is with Baran.

"I don't fear that mech when its true pilot is gone!!" Baran flicks the chain and, with rocket assistance, the hammer flies into Echidna's path. The Raioh's feet take the impact and the ball flies away, clipping the Bemidoban as it goes, but the attack is stopped.

"So you knew of the Lygeus Revival...Your agent spied on us, then?"

"If you hadn't decided to join the anti-alien factions, our alliance could have gone perfectly! You forced our hands, Shadow Mirrors!" Baran engages his remaining shoulder engine and yanks the chain back. The Raioh legs are suddenly entangled, and the super robot is now the one being dragged back.

"If you'd just been sensible..." The Bemidoban soaks up Harken Impulse shots as Echidna attempts to kick free, but the chain remain taut, and the Raioh is slammed down into the remnants of the Svartalf hangar, crushing it with the impact.

Then the ball hits. The shockwaves turn the remnants of the building to dust.

The kick takes the Bemidoban in the back, thumping another crater into its armor. Kai backflips off Dobans robot as the Assault Lander begins bombarding it with missiles and shells.

"You get da hell outta here, mon! You not welcome in dese parts!"

WHAT WILL BARAN DO? He's at least managed to take out the Raioh...for now. Luria and Brooklyn are still going at it, and the other Shadow Mirror transports are starting to warm up...

This is getting costly and most innefficient. Kar-Wai has been obtained, best retreat and have a nice MAN TO MAN chat with him. Besides, we don't want Euzeth getting near him. That wouldn't end well.

As far as they know, he went with the seventh fleet to find a new homeworld for the Balmar surivivors, while they went to check out Earth. There's been no contact with the Fleet, or the other 6, since. It's feared that the Zuvorg managed to pick them off...

Ahhhh. I thought it seemed like they weren't aware he was hanging around. Interesting... very interesting. Makes me wonder why they didn't question why the Judecca didn't show up. I suppose Bet Barshem told them that Katina had sent it back, at least. This adds an entirely new dimension to things... I hope we will be having more Doban intermissions in the future. Also, can we have another Yuuki intermission soon? I want to see how Yuuki and Carla are doing after what happened at the end of the SRX attack.

Battered worse than it has been in 158 years, the Bemidoban flies clear of the debris cloud and looks down at what his forces have managed. The Shadow Mirrors minor forces had been devestated, and dozens of their personnel siezed by the Megillots, but over half the swarm had been blasted out of the sky. The Zecheriahs had been stopped short by the fire of the battleships, just about managing to take the Rhinoceros. The Barshems ducked down behind cover as Randgriths shelled their positions. It seemed the assault had run up against a brick wall.

"All Balmar forces! General withdrawal!! Back to the warp point!"

Luris fires her shoulder cannons at the ground in front of the Rapiecage, giving her the opening she needs to boost away. She joins with Baran as they head to the need altitude. "They fight like devils!! Who would have thought a simple planet like this could create such warriors!!"

"Indeed. It seems that Euzeth chose wisely when he sent his Neviim to survey here...We must speak with Laodicea, this will require more than brute force, I fear..."

The lights of the Shadow Mirrors small fleet rise into the sky, as a purple haze covers the Balmar forces, and send them back to their reufge.

The Balmar came out at an advantage. They captured an ace and did a number on the Raioh, as well as kill a large number of the Shadow Mirror's non-ace pilots, while losing only drones and only taking moderate damage. And with only two aces on the field. This is why I say we need to recruit help. The Balmar are VERY nasty. The Aerogaters in OG1 were made up entirely of drones, brainwashed humans, out of whom only Kar-Wai and Tenzan had any actual military experience, and Ingram, all in low quality Balmarian units, save the Judecca and the Rivale/Astranagant.

(20 posts to Autosage, gonna finish up with some plot)

Laodicea looks incredulously at the two Royal Guards. "Are you seriously telling than even with several hundred Balmar units, you could not take one measly collection of humans?!?"

Baran furrows his brow. "There's no 'measly' about them, Commander! Those were veteran warriors, armed with the most advanced weapons of their planet, and even some of our tech! And its not like they got away unscathed!"

"But now you've lost them! We rely on the First's sensor network, which cannot keep track of their location, so we'll have to start looking for them all over again! We've squandered our best chance at cementing our alliance with the EFA, because you told me you could handle this job, and I beleived you!"

"Well perhaps if I'd had the forces I asked for! Megillots, seriously? Zechariah drones? I'd do better sending the sanitation servitors into battle!"

"Those are the forces we have! I can't summon up a fleet for you, and beleive me, we've been trying! A soldier has to work with what he ha-"

Commander Laodicea, I don't think arguing like this will help us.

Laodicea gazes up at the ceiling, where the voice reverberates from. "Patricia...Is Judecca speaking to you?"

Yes...and as much as I hate to subject my fellow humans to this, we need to up our game if we're going to save the Balmarians. Judecca is prepared to begin reviving the Neviims systems as best it can, and restart the program.[/i]

Baran's eyes widen. "No, you don't mean..."

I don't like it either, Mr Doban, but its our only option. We must begin to implement the Neviims purpose, and Sample the Earth.

The council chamber in Geneva is quiet, even as the arguments rage. Not a single one of the men and women at the table opens their mouths or changes expression, yet the Council rages back and forth, half a dozen sides silently shouting their piece back and forth.

"Enough!! We will have silence. Trueborn, what of the Artificial One? What can you tell us of her?"

Alfimi, out of place among the crisp business suits and stern unmoving faces, is the only one to speak aloud. "She is troubled, very troubled. She seeks succour, from the man she follows as much as her enemies. She is thinking of a refuge, given to her by Our Foe, and of a man who is no longer within this realm."

"Her...I knew we should not have allowed Her to become involved! I said so! Now our enemies are uniting against us!"

"Was that not the objective? To see if She would take the bait, and act openly against us?"

"This isn't open enough! We have no evidence we can bring to the natives to turn them against Her."

Alfimi coughs. "Firstborn, if I may...Allow me to track them. I have my link to the Artificial One, I can trace her and-"

"And what? Your skill is enough to face them one on one, but their strength is their unity! They need to be seperated, and scattered, so we can pick them off..."

"And how do you propose we do that?"

"I'm simply stating facts..."

"We don't need facts, we need a plan!!"

"Silence!! All of you, think rationally for once! Project Zeitgiest is nearly ready, and soon Beowulf will be ready to strike. We need only delay Her plans until then. With the Balmar's resources and our own, we can keep Her busy long enough for Her mechs and weapons to be meaningless. Now return to your sections, and find us targets we can strike at. Alfimi, prepare the Guardians. I will speak with the Mother, if she can intervene in some small fashion. In the meantime, we must prepare for the Integration..."
