## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

Back of Box Blurb:

Spurred on by their victories against the DC and the Inspectors, the EFA military have taken more and more control of the Earth Sphere, crushing all dissent beneath their heels. Only the Earth's Liberation Front stood in their way, but even these brave soldiers could not stop the juggernaut. Now, the only remaining source of dissent are the ELFs financial backers, the Shadow Mirrors. And even now, the EFA marshall their forces to stamp them out (Pic related).
The Shadow Mirrors no longer have a place in this world. It is time to find a new one.

MAIN CHARACTER SELECTED

From the Desk of Adler Koch, director of SCHOOL.

>Re: Incident #09322

>The pseudo-accidental death of student Bronzo 28 during scheduled recreation time is the final straw in the case of student Gab-12. It is increasingly clear that despite her demure attitude with the teachers and adoption of the predetermined personalised dress code assigned to her, she is unstable and prone to highly distruptive emotional outbursts, both during training and out of hours, distrupting the studies of her fellow students and throwing entire Sessions into total disrepute. This is despite multiple attempts to cure her using memory alteration, nerve staples and autohypnotic commands. Even the alternative of using her in the GEIM project studies is impossible due to her threatening to stab Mrs Rodam, the current director.

>Gab-12's indoctrination has been a partial success at best, and there is no such thing as partial success in the modern SCHOOL. Her student status is revoked with immediate effect. She is to receive a level 2 mind-wipe and be released ASAP.

>-Dr. Adler Koch.

>P.S. I no longer wish to recieve General Laker's constant memoranda about rejected students joining dissident groups. It is EFA Intelligence's job to track potential terrorists, our is to create Students. I will not entertain the man's ranting any longer.

2 Months Later:

"Well, you chose a hell of a time to join up."

Axel Almer looks you up and down, taking particular note of the purple frilled miniskirt you picked out today, to go with your pink shirt and the red ribbons. Then he looks into your left eye, then your right, compared the mismatched lenses.Then he turns back and looks out across the tarmac.

The Tesla-Liecht Institute is a hive of activity. A massive selection of pylons glows with energy, pumped through massive cables from dozens of fusion generators and the twisted hulks of a half-dozen of the old Grungust models. Into the cloud of energy an army is marching: Gespensts, transports, even some space cruisers are entering the vortex in space-time, dissappearing like mist into the unknown.

Beyond even that, the drums of war are beating, as flashes of battle resound across the surrounding hill. Shells burst not a hundred meters from the boundaries of the base, and energy beams threaten to outshine even the rifts light.

"A hell of a time, indeed."

"Ah, shur com'on Axel!" comes the irish twang of Russel Bagman, the man who saved you from the EFAI ambush in Germany and brought you this far. "She checks out as good as c'n'be! She passed the ELF checks, and she has Ms. Hamill's personal ok. Fer fecks sake, half o' yer soldier are Ex-SCHOOL, ye can't get uppity about her just because we're in a bit of a rush!"

"A bit of a...BEOWULF IS COMING, You Drunken Leprechaun-Fucker! Barrison Platoon is almost wiped out, 90% of our forces are locked in their transports, and Vindel has taken our trump card into the middle of the rift looking for a compatible universe. The last thing I need is a rogue element to mess things up."

You're about to break into the conversation (and possible Axel's nose) when a third man jumps in.

"If you can't handle the young lady, Axel, I'll be glad to take her off your hands. I know you're eager to find Beowulf, so delegate this little task to me."

Axel turns an eye up at Irm, then glances back at the battle, and then to an Earthgain-type robot kneeling on the tarmacadam. "Fine, you handle every other miniskirt in the Mirrors, what's one more." He breaks off and starts jogging towards his suit. "There's a half-dozen units left over in hanger G. If you're not on the battlefield in 5 minutes, I'll start bombing the place to get you moving."

Irm barely looks at him, he extends a friendly hand out to you. "Irmgard Kazahara, 2nd Lt, Pisces. I'm not usually this formal with a lady, but...would you care to come fly robots with me?"

"Eh, with us, Irm. I'm here too.", interjects Russel.

"Oh, are you asking for a threesome, Bags? 'Dorty, Dorty Oirishman'."

"Can we just get our feckin' mechs already?"

You're already halfway to Hanger G.

You open the door and start pulling the tarpaulin off the few remaining mechs in the hanger. Irm and Russel soon join you.

"Ladies first, you get first pick."

SELECT YOUR MECH

GESPENST MK2 M - Shadow Mirror version, with full weapons loadout. There are two, one in blue, one in red.

RANDGRITH - Fully loaded, with spare Split Missiles lashed to the shoulder shields.

GUARLION - Painted in blue and white, there is a spare railgun propped up against it.

??? - You're not familiar with this one, and your SCHOOL training taught you to identify almost every mechanised unit on the planet. It looks scratched and dented, as if it had just been roughly thrown out of a transport, and there are no weapons visible on it except some kind of head vulcan, and two very long knives.

Mmmm, knives.

CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY.

>Loot knives from Unknown, Tesla Drive from Guarlion; attach both to Randgrith.

You immediately mention this idea to your companions. They share a look before Irm pipes up.

"Uh, you know, Axel wasn't really joking when he said he'd blow this place up in 5 minutes. That's not enough time to field-strip a tesla drive."
"Ah, ye can't blame the lass fer a bit of imagination."
"No, but I can blame her if Axel fricasees me."

"Uhh...I can't decide."

Irm turns to you as he opens up the cockpit of the Guarlion. "What?"

"I want to take the one with the big knives, but that red Gespy...it's...it's too cute to leave here."

"Ugh, I'm all for having preferences, but I think we have to make some snap decisi-"

"No worries lass!" pipes up Russel. "I'm a fan of the Gespenst too, and I'll keep this one safe, and if ye'd like to swap mechs later, ye only have to ask!"

"Oh really! Thank you Mr Bagman."

"Ah tol' ye when we were on the plane, just call me Bags."

4 minutes after entering the hangar, the 3 mechs fly out of the hangar and towards the battle lines. Or at least, 2 of them do.

"What?! No Tesla Drive??!?" You cry as the grey mech hover-boosts after Irm and Russel.

Irm's face pops up on a comm window. "That mech is our latest prize catch, a Mao Industries test type called the R-Blade. Rumor has it its based off data from Project SRX."

Russel's whistle sounds over the comm. "That's some fierce secret stuff. I'm surprised we got to see it 'tall, Lemon would keep that thing in her sight, surely."

"She's already had it dismantled and put back together again. Hell, my father overheard her saying she's got the design work done on an improved model."

"Tha's some brain on that girl."

A cool, crisp voice cuts into the commstream. "Why thank you, Mr Bagman."

"Er, Ms Brownin', er, I was-"

"You and your friends were going to help Axel, where you not?"

"Right away, Ma'am." Irm turns his Guarlion and blasts off towards the battle, as does Russel.
You locate Lemon from her comm signal. She's in a well-equipped Assault Dragoon, probably the rumored new Ashsaber, with data cables leading from her cockpit to the Lygeus system. It seems she's monitoring the massive amounts of interdimensional space-time data required to keep the Shadow Mirrors escape going horribly wrong, and annoying her would be a bad plan. But you want to do it, so you will.

"Erm, Irm mentioned you had designed some kind of upgrade for this unit?"

A light cold chuckle comes over the comms. "The R-Eins? Oh, if the EFA had given us another week, we'd have them rolling off the production lines, along with the Ashsaber M, but alas, twas not to be. I have the plans with me however, so once we meet up in the new dimension, talk to me again about testing one out.

"Now run along dear."

You catch up with Irm and Russel as their flying mechs descend into the melee in a canyon leading to the labs. Irm descends in a hail of railgun rounds, taking out one Gespenst before driving his Assault Blade through the drive-trains of two more. He's obviously a skilled melee fighter, but he's also skittish, keeping the Guarlion moving at all times, desperately trying to avoid even the smallest of scratches. You take it he's used to sturdier units.

Russel, in comparison, is practically immobile, charging into combat with 3 PTs even as they attempt to shoot him out of the sky. He shrugs off their fire and gives one a plasma stake to the cockpit. Another is grabbed by the head and kicked in the crotch, causing the head and main camera to be torn off the neck. The third Gespenst fires its M13 wildly, but Russel advances almost calmly, angling his Gespents' curved armor to prevent any real damage. He draws his Energy Cutter and removes the EFA units right arm and leg in one slash.

However, distracted as he is, Russel fails to see another unit, this time a Schutzwald, round the corner and take aim at the back of his PT...

"I FUCK YOU WITH SWORD!!!"

At full boost you kick the Schutzwald with both feet, crushing its left arm as your Blade Tonfas slice up its cannons. Completely off balance, the pilot falls against the wall of the canyon, as you regain your feet, set your blades, and begin cutting.

And cutting.

Deeper. Deeper! Down into the guts!! Squish the pilot!! Break the engine core!!! KILL IT ALL BREAK EVERYTHING YES YES YESYESYES

"Er, are you a'right, lass?"

The R-Blade has been covered in hydraulic fluid and shredded brown armor. You realise you're breathing quite heavily into the comm line.

"Yes. I'm having a ball." You stow one of the blade tonfas and pick up the Schutzwald's handheld weapon.

"Don't just sit there, Bagsy, we have things to do."

OBTAINED: G-RAILGUN

WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

Irm leads the way, his Guarlion able to pop up to sight enemies and get back down before they return fire. He soon finds a group of five EFA Gespents this way, ducking down into a hollow just before a hail of beam and shell fire takes his units head off.

"Ack!! If only we could have kept one of the Earthgains, or even one of the old Grungusts. This things feels like it'll break if I sneeze without my helmet on."

"Well, we all wish we were 50 meters tall and crushing squishy weaklings beneath our metal feet."

"Er, well, I guess-"

"How many people can you fit under the feet of a Grungust at once, I wonder..."

"..."

Russel breaks the awkward moment. "I'll fire my Split Missiles to distract them, that'll give the two of you time to flank them."

You both signal acknowledgement. The missiles arc over the rocks, and strike the ground around the advancing EFA troopers. You and Irm pounce as one.

One pilot is rended as you stab through his cockpit, while putting G-rounds through the face of his friend who was pointing a Beam Rifle at you. You see Irm has cut down one enemy, and sends another reeling with a punch to the head, however, the third is just a little too fast for him to respond.

"I'll do just like Captain Kai taught me!! JET MAGNUM!!! RAAAAGH!!!"

The cocky Feddies blow takes the right arm off Irm's Guarlion and sends him reeling, well open for a second attack. Russel is hopping out of cover to support, but he may not make it in time.

The other remaining EFA pilot is trying to recover, picking up his Mega Beam Rifle and aiming it you, when Russel completes his landing on top of him, driving the Gespenst's head into its upper torso and its upper torso into the cockpit. However, Russel is a brawler, not a ballerina, and as the twisted lump of metal falls to the ground, his Gespenst does too. The coat of red paint is not in very good shape by this point.

You're already in motion, however. You've reacted quickly, so quickly in fact only a very small part of your brain registers that you have no idea what you're doing.

"Yeah!! The old one-two!! Just like Captain Kai said. Imma be a hero, just like Captain Kai! Punch terrosists and don't afraid of anyth-"

"OPTION D!!!" You scream as you simultaneously slice off the top half of the Feddie's units head, reverse-kneecap it with the G-railgun, and bodyslam the suit at full blast. The two of you go flying over the Guarlion, landing in a rough roll. The Gespenst's plasma stakes are driven into the ground and the arm torn off as the whole PT is wrenched around.

The R-Blade may not have a Tesla Drive but it is very nimble, and with some coaxing you get it to land on its feet, facing the fallen EFA mechs. Over the general comms, you hear the big damn hero bawling like a baby.

"AHUHUHUH! No! I want to live!!! I have a girl waiting for me at home! I have two!! Plea-hea-hea-hease! Bawhuhuhuhuuu!!"

"S-stupid EFA pilot! It's not like I hate you or anything...I JUST LOVE THE SOUND YOUR FLESH MAKES AS IT'S RENT IN BETWEEN THE SCRAP LEFT IN YOUR UNIT!"

And with that, you empty the clip of your railgun into his cockpit. The thing was busted up in the melee anyways.

Russel and Irm decline to comment on your actions as they pick themselves up. You retreive a new weapon.

LOST G-RAILGUN
OBTAINED MEGA BEAM RIFLE

"Well, it could be worse I suppose." says Irm, as he inspected the empty shoulder joint of his Guarlion. "I guess that means no more clsoe combat for me. I'll have to warm up the Breaker Field on this thing, but that means I have to take to the air, where I'd be exposed."

"No offense Irm boy, but we've taken two whole squads of them by ourselves. There's not much else we can do in this condition, we should head back to TLI and get in the queue for this escape tunnel thing."

You're about to chime in when another transmission interrupts you. "BZZZSSSHHHis Barrison Platoon, they've claimed the hieghts, forcing us back. Captain Almer can't hold them all back, we'll be overrun! Need assistance, pleSHSHBZZZ!!!"

People are always interrupting you today. Its getting really annoying

R-BLADE HP: 2300/3500
GESPENST HP: 2900/3700
GUARLION HP: 350/3700

"Russel, you and me will go help our units. Irm, you head back to TLI, you can't fight like that."

Irm turns the Guarlion to look at you as you sheath your second tonfa and pick up the railgun from his Guarlion's dismembered arm. It's a lot lighter than the G-Railgun, but has a high rate of fire.

OBTAINED: GUARLION RAILGUN

"Eh, no offense Ms Tarask, but I'm the commanding officer here-"

"Great!" says Russel. "So order us all back to base then!"

"Going back to base will be pointless if our defense line is overrun! We need to head to support them, or everyone at TLI will be caught in the crossfire! I'm not letting that happen to my dad and my friends!"

"Will you stop being sentimental I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIIIEEEEE!!!" You scream as you fire off the R-Blades Head Vulcans. The Guarlions head pops like a ripe melon and sparks fly as its other arm shorts out and falls limp.

Guarlion: 72/3700

"DAMMIT KATINA WHAT THE HELL!"

"WE'RE GOING RUSSEL! WE DON'T NEED THIS BLOCKHEAD!!!" You half drag Russel away from Irm, who seems rather bewildered by your forthright and dynamic command decisions.

By the time Irm switches to his backup camera, you're both gone. Sighing, he heads back to TLI.

The Rathgrith of the Barrison unit commander lies broken on the side of the hill, with the burning wrecks of a half-dozen EFA Gespensts on the slopes below. The three remaing Randgriths fire continuously, holding off EFA advancing up the hill, and the few brash feddies who risk using their tesla drives to gain hieght and bombard ther faltering Valkyria.

From the east, comes a blue blur. Hands aflame with the light of his passion, Axel's Soulgain tears through the enemy advance. One Gespenst is hit with a beam of light and sent flying, raining shrapnel on its allies. Another two are caught in a tornado made of cutting, falling to piece as the Soulgain's armblades twist in their arc of death.

As you arrive from the south, one of the Randgriths falls to its knees as its leg is bit with a beam shot, and tumbles down the slopes, scrabbling desperately for purchase before it tumbles straight into the hands of the relentless EFA. Axel is way to preoccupied with being awesome to help, and there are at least a half-dozen EFA units between you and the stricken pilot.

"You save that pilot, I'll go kill everything."

"Wait, lass, there's too many-"

"I AM THE ANGEL OF DEATH!!!"

The R-Blade boosts into the sky, weapons poised, while the Red Gespenst flies up the hill toward the downed Randgrith, dangling from a ledge.

#####COMMENCING FIRST ROUTE SPLIT.
######KATINA ROUTE

The combined fire from the Beam Rifle and Railgun lance down into the EFA line. One PT explodes, another is crippled, but the rest turn to meet the new threat. You boost down to hit cover, as a Massacre of Missiles heads towards you (thats the official term).

"What a contemptibly ill-planned attack."

Bursts of flame and shrapnel burst all around you as a blanket of anti-missile-missiles flows around you.

"Who-?"

200mm AP rounds fly past your head and plunge through the chests of two EFA troopers preparing to flank you.

"No concept of enemy reponse times, reinforcement position, or proper attack vectors."

Recognition. "I know you-"

Matrix missiles rain down on the open ground between you and the oncoming hordes, churning the slope into a maze of smoke and craters. You take the oppurtunity to dive into the zone of concealment, beaming a Gespensts arm off as you go.

"I'd estimate an survival rate of 15% if I had not compromised my position to support you."

"Subota?"

Barrison 3 stands tall on the peak of the hill, its guns smoking after the ferocious assault it just unleashed.

"You're hardly the first to recognise me here. Dropouts are common in the lower ranks, it would seem."

"Well, maybe, but what is the Queen of SCHOOL doing here, on the side of the Shadow Mirrors?"

"Behind you."

Without turning around, you sever the arms from the advancing Gespenst, and then stab both tonfas through the cockpit.

"I'm under no obligation to explain myself to a person who should be dead, Gab-12."

"My name is Katina!"

"I don't care."

#####RUSSEL ROUTE

Emptying a second clip from his M95, Russel beats back another EFA advance, as he draws ever-closer to the stranded pilot.

"Ah!! Sleigh!!" comes the young womans voice.

"Huh?"

"Sleigh!! Help me!!"

Rusself fires off his last set of Split Missiles and turns to the mysterious pilot.

"Ah'm a-feared y've got the wrong person, sweetheart. Name's Russel, and if ye don't mind, we need to get ya down from there."

"Ugh...ok." With Russel supporting her, the Randgrith made to a safe position, but with a leg badly damaged. "But I, I don't understand."

"We're in a big fight. You were shot and fell down here. I saved you."

"No! You don't get it! That's...that's Sleigh's Gespenst!! I'm sure of it, the red paint, the DC logo, the Scarlet Comet marked on the left shoulder...Where is she??"

"Missy, I don't-" Russel ducks as the EFA open up again. The two scramble down into a hollow for cover. "I don't know who this Gespenst could belong to. I just picked it up from the hanger not half an hour ago. No-one else claimed it, so I figured it was free for the taking."

"I....see."

"Now, can we maybe change the subject to us not dying?"

"Ok....But you have to promise me you'll keep that Gespenst safe, Sleigh will be needing it back!"

"Er, fine, whatever."

#####ROUTE RECOMBINATION

You cut your way through the Gespensts to where Axel is, as his oversized super robot crushes a Gespenst between its thighs, while its flying fists take out two more. The Soulgain looks none the worse for wear after all the fighting, where even a Super Earthgain unit would at least have taken a few bumps. It's quite the piece of technology.

"This is Barrison 2. Thank you, all of you. We've beaten them back! We're saved! I get to see Tyutti agai-"

"Above!!" shouts Latooni.

A blur of blue flies up over the ridge, and suddenly a rain of metal flies down from the sky. Titanium Cannonballs rain down at supersonic speeds. One hits your mech, snapping off a ten-metee length of wing. Several sink into Russel and Ibis's armor. Latooni's left shoulder shield and arm are shredded beyond use. Barrison 2 dissappears.

The blue blur lands. It's a third again as tall as your mech, twice as wide and, judging by the crater it made, three times the weight. It bears only the lightest of resemblances to its Gespenst brothers. It exudes power, weight, and menace.

"The Mk III!" breathes Latooni.

Axel twists the Soulgains hands into fists, and over the comm you hear his low growl.

"Beowulf!"

Over the ridge comes another wave of Gespenst, marked with the white badge of the Assault Team X-Terminators. The true elites of the EFA military have come to end the battle.

"You should have known better than to play such long odds, Axel."

"The old Kyosuke would never have said anything like that!"

"Yeah, well, I don't live in the past, like some people."

Two blue blurs leap at each other. Where they meet, the earth cracks. Sonic booms resound across the battlefield, as two great powers clash, perhaps for the last time.

Blasting back up the hill to escape the fire from the oncoming EFA, you hear an odd beeping sound over the comms.

"Tha's the final signal!!" hollers Russel. "They've cleared out the last of them and set the charges! We've got five minutes to get to the portal!"

Everyone turns towards the TLI, and the white light of hope coming from Lygeus. Even Axel breaks off from his battle, with the wrecking ball of the Nacht making a furrow in the earth as it follows him.

THIS IS THE FINAL DECISION FOR TONIGHT. YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

1) ENTER PORTAL, HEAD TO OG-VERSE, LULZ ENSUE, FUCK UP BANPRESTO'S STORYLINE.

2) KICK REASON TO THE CURB, STAY IN SHADOW MIRROR VERSE, MEET SM VERSIONS OF ENTIRE CAST.

/m/ has decided...by not deciding.

Originally I thought, just go to the OGverse, it'll be fun there changing the canon storyline. Then people started talking about SM versions of pretty much everyone. Then I started thinking about the possibilities, so I thought, well maybe we should stay in SM-verse.

But then, at crunchtime, /m/ can't decide. It wants both, the OGverse to fuck up and the SMverse to explore. Well, if this thread has taught me anything, its that if you can't decide between two choices, take both.

So you get both /m/. Welcome to Opposite Day.

SECRET ROUTE NUMBER 3: AND THEN EVERYTHING WENT WRONG IN THE MOST AWESOME WAY POSSIBLE.

Carrying the head-cockpit of Ibis' Randgrith like the rugby balls of his youth, Russel blasts towards TLI. You're hot on his heels, and Latooni pushs her Randgrith to the limit, firing back at the EFA as she goes.

You're about halfway to the portal when it turns red. You're two-thirds of the way there when objects start flying out.

Transports. Mecha. Jets. Half a space cruiser. Bodies.

As you arrive at the scene, two objects in particular stand out: The Ashsaber, lying face-down on the tarmac, and the Zweizergain, missing an arm and with half the lights on its body extinguished.

"What. The hell." Russel speaks for you all: The Zweizergain was the core of the whole plan, the link between the two worlds. What the hell is it doing back here?

And then, something emerges through the portal.

Vindel drags the broken Zweizergain into a sitting position, and spits out a single word.

"Helios..."

"If you're still as smart a man as you were, Vindel, you'll stay down. I killed you once already, I don't want to do it again."

"Wh...what do you mean, again?"

"The time-shunt was a feature of the XN system that I never figured out how to control. Each time I've seen it operate, it sends its user back in time relative to the universe they just left. Had you used it, you would have arrived several months in the relative past, before the Neo DC War or Inspectors, allowing you to predict what was about to happen and quickly turn yourselves into a powerful political entity in the Earth Sphere again. And now we use it to come here, and we end up arriving you even leave to come to our world."

"What are you...why are you here?"

"You came to our world, attempted to start your campaign of pointless conflict, and then we defeated you. We were willing to leave it at that. But now things have changed, Vindel. Far more than a few lives in either world, far beyond anything even I had imagined.

"We can't let your world invade ours anymore. We have to invade yours."

Then, the mechs begin to pour through.

END MISSION 1

OH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE.
