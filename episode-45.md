In our last thread, our heroine Katina Tarasdk had almost convinced the Irregulars to give her breakaway Shadow Mirrors the Zweizergain, so they could travel to the New World confident in being able to return. Howeever, negotiations were interrupted when aliens mechs attacked a nearby Russian city, capturing dozens of people and leaving large chunks of the city in ruins. Into this mess comes three mysterious mecha pilots calling themselves the Snipers, who claim this is the harbinger of an all-out attack by the Balmarians. An awkward situation, as Katina and Dumi had been trying to get the Balmarians as their allies...

You nearly just over the table at Ryoma. "You ignorant shithead! Can't you even tell the difference between civilians and military? Or are you racist as well as sexist?"

The powerfully built man stands up, followed by everyone else in the room. This is quickly getting heated.

"You really think the Balmar are in nice little packets of good and evil, you frilly little poodle? They don't have civilians, they're all part of their war machine. That's how the Balmar work. That's the kind of monsters they are! That's-"

Thats a direct contradiction of what your friend said a minute ago.

Ryoma stops up short. Kojiko grits her teeth and stares angrily at him.

I think we all need to step back from this situation and think for a second. You, the Snipers, obviously want allies to fight off the Balmarian threat, which is paramount right now as you see it. The Irregulars, however, have a different set of priorities, one where they either fight a long and bloody war against multiple factions for moral reasons, or where they leave this planet and earn a bit of peace for their efforts to date. We, meanwhile, seek to leave this planet in order to gain battle strength, as the factions of this world, both alien and human, are too fragmented and idealogical to rely on."

Amuro frowns. "Wait...what exactly do you mean by 'leave the planet'?"

Dumis eye turns slightly to look at you. The implication is clear.

STAY COY, OR BRING THE EXTRADIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THE FACTIONS HERE TO THE SNIPERS ATTENTION?

I don't like these guys and i don't think we should be letting them know we have inter-dimensional plans - especially when they've already declared themselves some kind of multiversal anti-balmar force.

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do here, actually. I'm fairly certain we don't want to deal with the Snipers a whole lot more than we have to, they're dangerous and unknown elements. The reaction if we tell them we're leaving this dimension may be violent, in which case I'd feel a lot safer if we had Arado here. On the other hand, they might be able to provide us with a means back, though I'm not convinced.

What comes to mind at the moment is persuading them to come along with us to make sure this new universe isn't under threat from the Balmarians.

Dumi looks at you. You look at Tetsuya. Then so does everyone else.

"Er...Why am I the centre of attention all of a sudden?"

You wag your finger dissapprovingly. "Now-now, Captain Anglerfish, you're the commander of this outfit. It wouldn't do me to be doing your job for you. You should be the one talking here."

"I see...Well...So you want to know what our current intentions are, do you?"

The three newcomers nod. Kojiko starts up again. "If you're not going to be present for the upcoming battle, then we don't have much else to discuss, now do we? Although abandoning the planet to be chopped up by aliens...Hardly the honorable thing to do."

Tetsuya nods. He looks around the room at Lefina, Kyosuke, the Other Irm (Oh god don't look too hard he'll see you!), the Other Kai (Can't decide on eyepatch vs no eyepatch), Viletta (she looks oddly familiar...).

Then Tetsuya Onodera turns to the three.

"Our friend Dumi is a little behind on things. We're not going anywhere just yet."

I've said this before, but I *really* don't trust these guys at the moment. They've shown up to conveniently save us from a conveniently timed attack while conveniently having the ability to save the captives and being conveniently prepared to start and info-war against an opponent who even more conveniently can't speak up to defend themselves while possessing all sorts of 'proof' which conveniently paints the balmarians as a genocidal race.
That is *far* too much convenience in one go for my liking.

Kojiko nods at Tetsuya. "Nice to know you have your priorities straight..."

"Now hold on, we never said anything about fighting in your war. We plan to give every side the benefit of the doubt, and that includes the Balmarians. We won't be making any rash moves, we've learnt better than that."

"Understandable. I too would like to see if there's anything to this computers talk of two factions."

"We also have more pressing concerns, like the EFA and their wanting to hunt us down."

"We...might be able to help you with that. We're nothing if not agreeable, despite our..." She eyes her comrades disapprovingly. "...Brusque nature."

"Very well then...We need to start prioritising then."

WHAT WILL KATINA SUGGEST NOW? Remember, Katina influences Dumi, who influences everyone else. Otherwise, she could just leave the meeting, and see what happens then.

THIS WAS NOT PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT.

Laodicea represses the urge to shout at the bodiless voice of the First Ambassador. "We haven't done anything, I assure you. These units were not from the Neviim. You said that you would arrange the gathering of samples on our behalf, and we've held to that.

THEN KINDLY EXPLAIN THE ALIEN MECHS IN IZHEVSK.

"We...Our agent among the Irregulars obtained telemetry on that force. They're Balmarian made, but not of a type that the Neviim is equipped with. They're not ours, they must be from some other group."

ANOTHER GROUP OF BALMARIANS. THAT MAKES THIS YOUR PROBLEMZHZHZH

"I can't beleive that! It must be some other race, like the Zuvor...Hello?"

ZHZHZZZHZHZH

Laodicea spins on his heel to the bridge consoles behind him. "Systems Officers! Explain this interruption at once!"

"Commander, theres been a tidal failure in the comms units! Both EM and Hyperwave comms have gone offline!"

"How? There's no chance of power failure, it must be...Sabotage!"
I don't understand, I can't get through. There shouldn't be anything stopping a hyperwave transmission from getting through, but I amn't even getting a confirmation signal.

Tetsuya grimaces. "So you're being stonewalled?"

I can't say...It could be equipment failure, or some form of jamming that I can't detect...

"Whatever the reason, it doesn't seem like we'll be talking to the Balmarians as we are now..."

Tetsuya looks at you. "I don't think we can prioritise that right now, however. We need to meet up with Gilliam and the others first, then we can see where to place our forces, to see what we can do for this world..."

Ryoma, as if he'd been waiting for a cue, hops out of his chair and heads to the door. "Well, we can't wait around for that. We have to get the word out, and, as you so kindly pointed out, apparently we have to make sure we don't get any 'innocent' Balmars killed."

Kojiko shakes her head. "We'll leave you contact frequencies. We've gotten access to some disuses EFA channels, they should give us secure comms. If you do decide to find out the truth for yourselves, let us know, and we'll accompany you. It should be interesting to see if the Balmarians really do have a peaceful side..."

The Eurydice was not the easiest ship to find private space on, but its tesla drives were quiet, so the crawlspace was at least peaceful.

Arado looks down on Lenonjayce as the man hugs himself. "How are you...holding up?"

"I...I keep seeing the accident...Every time I close my eyes I see the WildRaubtier bursting into flames. I...I'm not like you, I still need to sleep every so often...But I'm scared, if this is what I see when I'm awake, what will my nightmares be like?"

"..Well shit, I've got nothing on that."

Arado flops down beside the beleagured pilot. "I mean, I keep replaying my death over and over, but it's not terrible... I can keep my brain busy by trying to convince Seo...Here-and-now problems take priority, at least."

"I...I can't concentrate...I'm a fully qualified pilot and mechanic, I should be able to...I'll find something to do...But everytime I see a mech, I see her burning..."

"No. No mechs. You need to talk to people, Starlord. Make some friends, make some enemies, fall in love and get in fights. If it can keep people like me, Lat and Katina halfway sane, it can work for you."

You shout after the Snipers. "And remember just play defense! If I find out you've attacked the Neviim behind our backs, I'll see you all drawn and quartered!"

The Snipers do not reply, simply heading down to the hangar.

You turn back to the Irregulars. "Ok, that unpleasantness is done. Now, you guys are gonna be staying after all?"

Tetsuya nods. "At the very least, we're going to see what we can do. Its unlikely we'll be able to do as much as you might like, though. We'll meet the Giest around the middle east and plan from there."

"Ok, but, won't you be stuck here if you do stay? Dumi won't be around to help you get home."

In we successfully create the New World, there won't be a Paradox Storm holding them here. They should be able to return to their world with the XN Giest. The main issue, I feel, is whether their staying changes your strategy, Katina. Are you going to retain our original plan to create a home in the New World, or are you going to stay to fight with the Irregulars, and see if their battle strength is enough to turn the tide?

"Huh, didn't think of that..."

I should point out, Katina, that if you stay, theres even elss reason for them to leave the Zweizergain here. You will be bereft of options for travelling to find me in the New World. In the worst case...That could be the last we'd see of each other...

Anyway, this doesn't change our intentions in the least. A good part of our motivation is gaining our own source of power so we don't have to rely on others anymore. And while the Irregulars DO seem a little incompetent and indecisive so far, they can certainly hold down the fort here. This just gives us -more- reason to go, sonce with them here we don't have to worry so much about whats going on here.

Besides, Dumi is our partner. Forever. No way in hell will we let him ride alone.

You once more point the Finger of Power at Tetsuya. "We're going to save our world the same way you did yours: We go to another world to find the keys we need. And if we make mistakes, if we end up hurting that New World, then we'll fix it again after, just like you promised to do here! You can try to twist out of it, but we're doing the same exact thing, OreoDorito! And just like we gave you the oppurtunity to get home after, you owe us the same! After all this, after all both groups have struggled through...We deserve no less."

Tetsuya looks about him.

Lefina looks oddly at you, as if she's used to this. "You know Katina, Tetsuya, you're not going to dissuade her from this..."

Kirk Hamill nods. "It would seem they have that ability, indeed. Not that we'd be able to engage them with Squadron X still in repair."

"We built them tough, both machines and pilots, I expect they'd be ready sooner than your engineers might think. But I wasn't intending to engage the Irregulars, Hamill. That would be too much of a distraction at this critical stage. I was merely hoping to infiltrate their number, or at least bug their ships."

"Director, don't we have more more pressing matter to deal with?"

Yukiko smiles thinly. "These 'Balmarians'? We already have a lead on them, a full disclosure from one of our trusted people?"

"How did you manage that, Director?"

"It seems the Shadow Mirrors have been helping us in more ways than we thought. Kobayashi-1 was just dropped off on the Japanese mainland 12 hours ago, and immediately called in for collection. We're taking the time to fully debrief her without risk of mental shock, but her preliminary reports are quite interesting."

This communication technique will allow you to monitor what happens to the Zweizergain in the other world with regular reports. All you have to do is program the monitoring device in a way that leaves you satisfied I haven't tampered with it. Given your skill in making the Giest in the first place, that shouldn't be an issue for you, Mr. Yeager.

Yeager frowns. It looks like he still hasn't gotten the right amount of sleep to be dealing with such lofty goals, but then you did sort of surprise him by teleporting in front of them as they passed Malta.

"And will the spare parts from the Giest be enough to act as this 'seed' for the new world?"

I'll need pieces from the Giest, the Zweizergain, and some of my own body, but it should be enough to start the reaction while leaving the Giest interdimensional capabilities intact, allowing you to get home as you need to.

Gilliam shakes his head. "To be able to do so much with so little...I need one more guarantee."

Something more than just a monitor then?

Gilliam nods. "I want to be able to destroy the Zweizergain at any point. I can't let it be abused by you or any party that gets its hands on it. A combination slave circuit and bomb, if I can install that, only then will I let it go."

You look worried, Bet Barshem. Presumably the inability to contact the Neviim has you quite anxious as to your chances for retrieval.

"I'll admit I wasn't expecting this...This isn't a simple equipment failure.[/i]

No, the Neviims comms array has been deliberately put offline. I can't tell for certain without going into orbit, but I don't think its been attacked, so the best theory at the moment would be internal sabotage.

"This second faction you suggested?"

I didn't want to push the issue in front of the Irregulars, they seem suspicious of your people and probably for good reason. But yes, I think either more Balmarians have arrived in our system...Or Commander Laodiceas actions have caused a schism.

"What do you mean by that?"

I haven't told any of the other Shadow Mirrors about your attack on our base camp. Irm asked for an update and I said they'd been attacked but fleed intact, but was vague on the who. I don't judge you negatively for it, Vindel's loyal Shadow Mirrors are basically my enemies. But given both the political backstabbing it represents, and the military failure of your first operation, I'd imagine its made the politics among the Neviim's crew quite complex...Dangerous, even.

"What exactly are you implying, Duminass?"

That you can't go back as it is. And you can't stay here with the Irregulars, your nature would be too....complex for them to handle rationally. You're fresh out of options, Bet Barshem...You have to come with us.

The Aurgelmir could time-travel, but whether it could dimension-jump never came up. But the reason it could do this is because it absorbed the remnants of the Astranagant, the same fragments that, once Gaiden was over and time changed, would go on to become the Werkbau and Dis Astranagant.

I ascribe to the theory that the Dis is a singularity point, and can't appear in multiple universes, so even if Sophia were to turn into Magus and make an Aurgelmir, she'd still need to find a new Black Box.

Seolla: Protesting less, but still isn't in favor of the trip.
Arado: Now that you've confirmed you're going, so has he.
Sophia and Wodan: Lynchpins of the plan.

Axel and Lamia: Going

Tytti: Going
Bet Barshem: Dumi says she wants to come all of a sudden. Oh Well...
Coop: Has changed into his Fuck With Space-Time pants.
Dr Andrews: Going
Jamie: "Will there be chicks?"

Mech/Ship Complement:

Eurydice: Hiryu-II scout vessel
Illusion of Serenity: Highly customised Stealth Transport
R-Blade: Equipped with G-Railgun, G-Revolver, and a Tesla Drive.
Thrudgelmir: It has drills and lasery death. Still seems to be missing something, however...
Huckebien EX: It's gotten minor repairs, but the simple fact is that its missing both arms, a leg, and most of its head. The Black Hole Cannon is still there though....it's just twisted into a pretzel shape.

And the Compatible Kaiser, another Key to the Plan.
And the Eleos, Hypocrisis, and Thugater.

There is only one outstanding issue: WILL TOUMA AND SLEIGH COME WITH YOU? Touma wants to join you to ensure the Kaisers Perfect Base of Justice goes properly. Sliegh would rather wait for the Kaiser to rematerialise back in the SMVerse. You more or less have the deciding vote.

Well, I've been thinking, and I came up with these.

Possible improvements to the Algol:
1.Instead of having twin shotguns, how about twin Oxtongue Rifles, modified for Super Robot hands? The Algol should be large enough to wield each of them one-handed with no problems.
2.Sticking a plasma charger or something into each blade segment, so that they can be charged up with power and then 'shoot' a powerful bolt of lightning. Basically, thunder funnels!
3.Drill fingertips. Because those are always awesome. If not on the Algol, then on something else.

Also, the module system for Seolla's mech, whatever its called - Perhaps make it closer to Kotetsu Jeeg than Turn X?

Also bump.

I think it's been established that the shotgun look is only cosmetic - any gun sized for a super robot is nothing short of a hand-carried battleship cannon. Think DGG-02's Lanzerkanones.

The Plasma Tonfa are basically already lightning funnels - they're electricity-coated blades attached to the wrists by lightning tethers. That said, it's an idea with some merit...maybe for our ranged attack, we charge up lightning in one of the blades or the hands and throw it in a bolt at the enemy?

Drill fingertips might be appropriate for Lanius, but I'm not sure.

I think we moved away from the Einsamkeit being a part-swapping unit a couple threads back. Seolla's a very specialized pilot, it doesn't make a lot of sense to give her a mech that goes for extreme versatility when all she wants to do is stay back and snipe things from across the map.

Derp, I repeated almost exactly what you said with regards to the lightning. So yes, I agree, but I'd stipulate that we should probably only be doing this one while the blades are attached. The mental image becomes really awkward otherwise.

Jayces body was heavily replaced due to the damaged he recieved, so he should be on a level with Hiroshi. He'd need to be reconstructed again, however.

It wouldn't work with Arado though. His augments are low-key and highly organic in nature, as most of his body was fine after death. He's less Cyborg and more pistons hidden in his bones, fibers added to muscles, organs augmented with super-steroids etc.

Although how Machine Cells would work with the likes of Jeeg could be interesting to see.

Like I said before, I'd actually prefer that we have all /m/ Originals, without any existing series, though I'll make an exception for the missing Banpresto Originals like the D, W, J and K originals. I feel like this is a better plan for two main reasons:

First, it's more interesting to me for us to encounter new characters that are in many cases all-new creations, featuring mechs that haven't seen use in proper stories before. This will also prevent us from acting on prejudices with much of the cast - don't tell me you won't want to act a certain way towards Domon just because he's Domon, even if this one is an alternate version who won't behave like the original. We will almost certainly set ourselves up for a -lot- of falls in this manner.

Second, I question our decisions for picking a lot of these non-original series. Do we want a lot of this because we want the characters and plots involved, or just because we want hotblood and broken robots? Because we'll get hotblood no matter what we pick, and we really shouldn't gun for broken robots. We won't get them on our side, we'll just end up neutral to them at best, enemies at worst. At least in sticking with the /m/ Originals, we avoid having to deal with fighting things that are on Killer of God tier because we thought they'd be totally awesome to have on our team five threads before.

To the first point, a lot of that is because we were informed long before we met them of just how different these versions were. Look at our interactions with many of the SM versions of the OG characters - in many cases, particularly with people like Kai, we've given awesome characters the benefit of the doubt when it wasn't necessarily wise. It is a point of concern.

As for the second: We tend not to do a great job of making allies and keeping them, and that's when we're -not- invaders. Plus, there's the simple fact that Sciencegar would be a damn fool to let us have things like Getter or Demonbane on our side.

True, but we also DID get distracted from our task. Repeatedly. We've been getting better about it, but we still need to work on prioritizing better.

Ah, yes, the days when rape and molestation and adding to the harem took priority over what's actually important.

Sometimes they still do.

I have nothing against rape and molestation. The problem is that we used to let it get in the way of getting things done. We're learning to prioritize better. Call it character developement. Which Katina has undergone quite a bit of.

Nothing even remotely the same level. Thrudgelmir doesn't even have its Zankantou, if you hadn't noticed, and Dumi's about to get a severe power-down. Assuming this puts Dumi back in the form of DGG-04, both are just potent super robots, not slayers of empires and worlds.

Of course. It was just back in those days when said antics used to frequently override the plot and nothing would be done.

Couch, given that we're going to be going up against the SRX, Judecca, Einst, quite possible Nashim Ganedan, and maybe even Keisar Ephes, we might be within our rights to have some level of god mode. And that's always assuming nothing WORSE shows up.

Still, I feel like we're better off forging our own swords to deal with these threats than grabbing a broken weapon from someone else's fiction to deal with them. It goes along with my feelings behind our motivations for doing this jump in the first place - if we're just relying on other people's strength, are we really accomplishing anything?

Well, if you want to try to construct your own god-killer, be my guest.

Considering how strictly tronium was rationed and how valuable prototypes were earlier on, finding parts and materials to build such a machine with, unless it's handily pre-made, would be pretty arduous.

I'll point out that the OG Numbers, not sporting god-killer mechs, have successfully dealt with the first three of the listed enemies. Ganedan and Ephes haven't been fought in OG yet, but even normal mechs can hurt them in Alpha - I'm pretty sure we're not intended to read these fights as Ideon, Shin Getter, and Dis Astranagant doing all the work. We can match all the various main character mechs, even exceed them to degrees, with the tech we already have or are already working on.

And yet, even though the Numbers didn't have god-tier mechs themselves, they were still pretty high, and they were supported by the very mechs you listed.

"Dumi, what the fuck am I seeing? What's with all the purple clouds?"

You're not really seeing anything, Katina, you mind can't really grasp the void between universes. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to begin.

Touma and Sleigh indicate readiness. "The Overgate Engine is ready, The Warrior will give you full power."

A most impressive artifact, I can see why Dark Brain wanted it now...Ok, igniting the Seed.

The amalgam of parts around the Kaiser begins to glow. Slowly, but surely, a bubble of some sort begin to form around the group, as the stormclouds dissipate, and show what lies behind them...

"My god, it's full of stars..."

Very funny Katina. Those are the shards, locked into a usable formation. Now, we begin integration...

Dumis brainlike form begins to glow even brighter than the Shards, but not with light. You look out at the whiteness of his form, as it starts to fray around the edges.

Rings voice comes over the comms from the bridge of the Eurydice. "Amazing...The calculations are so intense he has to burn up his own computing mass to make them."

The points of light representing the fragments shift, transitting across the non-sky, forming the infinitely dense pattern that is needed to prevent them destroying themselves as they merge.

Initial calculations...complete. Touma, S-sliegh, you'll be integrating....first. Stand...by...

The Bubble collapses, forming around the Compatible Kaiser like a golden skin. It glows with gentle light, then slowly begins to face away.

Then the Shard strikes it, and its gone.

The Shards come on all at once. One grazes the Illusion of Serenity, and it dissapears. Another slams into the Thrudgelmir, which absorbs it faster than the eye can follow. The Shards coalesce around Dumi, as his body frays after like its in a blender.

"DUUMII!!"

It's Okay!! The New World is forming, even faster than I anticipated. Integration probability stable at 100%...But I won't be able to keep us together in the same Shard!

"For once will you just use some fucking English!?!!?"

....Find me, Katina. I'll be waiting for you...

And then....You're Somewhere.
