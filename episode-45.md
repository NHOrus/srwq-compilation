# Episode 45

##SRWQ Mission 45: I'm starting to think this plotline might be a touch too ambitious

In our last episode, our heroine Katina Tarasdk had almost convinced the Irregulars to give her breakaway Shadow Mirrors the Zweizergain, so they could travel to the New World confident in being able to return. Howeever, negotiations were interrupted when aliens mechs attacked a nearby Russian city, capturing dozens of people and leaving large chunks of the city in ruins. Into this mess comes three mysterious mecha pilots calling themselves the Snipers, who claim this is the harbinger of an all-out attack by the Balmarians. An awkward situation, as Katina and Dumi had been trying to get the Balmarians as their allies...

---

You nearly just over the table at Ryoma. "You ignorant shithead! Can't you even tell the difference between civilians and military? Or are you racist as well as sexist?"

The powerfully built man stands up, followed by everyone else in the room. This is quickly getting heated.

"You really think the Balmar are in nice little packets of good and evil, you frilly little poodle? They don't have civilians, they're all part of their war machine. That's how the Balmar work. That's the kind of monsters they are! That's-"

*Thats a direct contradiction of what your friend said a minute ago.*

Ryoma stops up short. Kojiko grits her teeth and stares angrily at him.

*I think we all need to step back from this situation and think for a second. You, the Snipers, obviously want allies to fight off the Balmarian threat, which is paramount right now as you see it. The Irregulars, however, have a different set of priorities, one where they either fight a long and bloody war against multiple factions for moral reasons, or where they leave this planet and earn a bit of peace for their efforts to date. We, meanwhile, seek to leave this planet in order to gain battle strength, as the factions of this world, both alien and human, are too fragmented and idealogical to rely on."*

Amuro frowns. "Wait... what exactly do you mean by 'leave the planet'?"

*Dumis eye turns slightly to look at you. The implication is clear.*

Dumi looks at you. You look at Tetsuya. Then so does everyone else.

"Er... Why am I the centre of attention all of a sudden?"

You wag your finger dissapprovingly. "Now-now, Captain Anglerfish, you're the commander of this outfit. It wouldn't do me to be doing your job for you. You should be the one talking here."

"I see... Well... So you want to know what our current intentions are, do you?"

The three newcomers nod. Kojiko starts up again. "If you're not going to be present for the upcoming battle, then we don't have much else to discuss, now do we? Although abandoning the planet to be chopped up by aliens... Hardly the honorable thing to do."

Tetsuya nods. He looks around the room at Lefina, Kyosuke, the Other Irm (Oh god don't look too hard he'll see you!), the Other Kai (Can't decide on eyepatch vs no eyepatch), Viletta (she looks oddly familiar...).

Then Tetsuya Onodera turns to the three.

"Our friend Dumi is a little behind on things. We're not going anywhere just yet."

Kojiko nods at Tetsuya. "Nice to know you have your priorities straight..."

"Now hold on, we never said anything about fighting in your war. We plan to give every side the benefit of the doubt, and that includes the Balmarians. We won't be making any rash moves, we've learnt better than that."

"Understandable. I too would like to see if there's anything to this computers talk of two factions."

"We also have more pressing concerns, like the EFA and their wanting to hunt us down."

"We... might be able to help you with that. We're nothing if not agreeable, despite our..." She eyes her comrades disapprovingly. "...Brusque nature."

"Very well then... We need to start prioritising then."


---

THIS WAS NOT PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT.

Laodicea represses the urge to shout at the bodiless voice of the First Ambassador. "We haven't done anything, I assure you. These units were not from the Neviim. You said that you would arrange the gathering of samples on our behalf, and we've held to that.

THEN KINDLY EXPLAIN THE ALIEN MECHS IN IZHEVSK.

"We... Our agent among the Irregulars obtained telemetry on that force. They're Balmarian made, but not of a type that the Neviim is equipped with. They're not ours, they must be from some other group."

ANOTHER GROUP OF BALMARIANS. THAT MAKES THIS YOUR PROBLEMZHZHZH

"I can't beleive that! It must be some other race, like the Zuvor... Hello?"

ZHZHZZZHZHZH

Laodicea spins on his heel to the bridge consoles behind him. "Systems Officers! Explain this interruption at once!"

"Commander, theres been a tidal failure in the comms units! Both EM and Hyperwave comms have gone offline!"

"How? There's no chance of power failure, it must be... Sabotage!"

---

I don't understand, I can't get through. There shouldn't be anything stopping a hyperwave transmission from getting through, but I amn't even getting a confirmation signal.

Tetsuya grimaces. "So you're being stonewalled?"

I can't say... It could be equipment failure, or some form of jamming that I can't detect...

"Whatever the reason, it doesn't seem like we'll be talking to the Balmarians as we are now..."

You pout at this news. "So we'll have to go up there ourselves to check..."

Tetsuya looks at you. "I don't think we can prioritise that right now, however. We need to meet up with Gilliam and the others first, then we can see where to place our forces, to see what we can do for this world..."

Ryoma, as if he'd been waiting for a cue, hops out of his chair and heads to the door. "Well, we can't wait around for that. We have to get the word out, and, as you so kindly pointed out, apparently we have to make sure we don't get any 'innocent' Balmars killed."

Kojiko shakes her head. "We'll leave you contact frequencies. We've gotten access to some disuses EFA channels, they should give us secure comms. If you do decide to find out the truth for yourselves, let us know, and we'll accompany you. It should be interesting to see if the Balmarians really do have a peaceful side..."

Amuro merely looks about worriedly, bows slightly, and heads after his two companions.

---

The Eurydice was not the easiest ship to find private space on, but its tesla drives were quiet, so the crawlspace was at least peaceful.

Arado looks down on Lenonjayce as the man hugs himself. "How are you... holding up?"

"I... I keep seeing the accident... Every time I close my eyes I see the WildRaubtier bursting into flames. I... I'm not like you, I still need to sleep every so often... But I'm scared, if this is what I see when I'm awake, what will my nightmares be like?"

"...Well shit, I've got nothing on that."

Arado flops down beside the beleagured pilot. "I mean, I keep replaying my death over and over, but it's not terrible... I can keep my brain busy by trying to convince Seo... Here-and-now problems take priority, at least."

"I... I can't concentrate... I'm a fully qualified pilot and mechanic, I should be able to... I'll find something to do... But everytime I see a mech, I see her burning..."

"No. No mechs. You need to talk to people, Starlord. Make some friends, make some enemies, fall in love and get in fights. If it can keep people like me, Lat and Katina halfway sane, it can work for you."

The purple-skinned boy half-drags the golden-eyed man out into the engine room problem. "No more hide-away crawlspaces. You're going to the mess hall, and you're going to talk to people. I'm sure some of the peons there count as people..."

You shout after the Snipers. "And remember just play defense! If I find out you've attacked the Neviim behind our backs, I'll see you all drawn and quartered!"

The Snipers do not reply, simply heading down to the hangar.

You turn back to the Irregulars. "Ok, that unpleasantness is done. Now, you guys are gonna be staying after all?"

Tetsuya nods. "At the very least, we're going to see what we can do. Its unlikely we'll be able to do as much as you might like, though. We'll meet the Giest around the middle east and plan from there."

"Ok, but, won't you be stuck here if you do stay? Dumi won't be around to help you get home."

*If we successfully create the New World, there won't be a Paradox Storm holding them here. They should be able to return to their world with the XN Giest. The main issue, I feel, is whether their staying changes your strategy, Katina. Are you going to retain our original plan to create a home in the New World, or are you going to stay to fight with the Irregulars, and see if their battle strength is enough to turn the tide?*

"Huh, didn't think of that..."

*I should point out, Katina, that if you stay, theres even elss reason for them to leave the Zweizergain here. You will be bereft of options for travelling to find me in the New World. In the worst case... That could be the last we'd see of each other...*

"Fuck that! I said we'd be partners forever, Dumi, and I meant it!"

You once more point the Finger of Power at Tetsuya. "We're going to save our world the same way you did yours: We go to another world to find the keys we need. And if we make mistakes, if we end up hurting that New World, then we'll fix it again after, just like you promised to do here! You can try to twist out of it, but we're doing the same exact thing, OreoDorito! And just like we gave you the oppurtunity to get home after, you owe us the same! After all this, after all both groups have struggled through... We deserve no less."

Tetsuya looks about him.

Lefina looks oddly at you, as if she's used to this. "You know Katina, Tetsuya, you're not going to dissuade her from this..."

Kyosuke's frown looks about normal. "If they do plan something against us, they're either really good at bluffing or they're going all-in on a bad hand."

Irm grins a grin you haven't seen on your Irm for a while. "I dunno Captain, but my heart tells me this pretty thing isn't going to two-time us."

Kai grunts. "Frankly, I'm starting to think Katinas in charge of this group, not Duminass, and we have nothing to fear in that case."

Viletta ponders (ARGH! You have her before but WHERE goddamnit?). "If all she's asking for is a chance to fight for the future of her world... It'd be rather hypocritical of us to deny that, wouldn't it?"

Tetsuya nods. "Alright... Once we rendevous, I'll talk to Gilliam, and see if we can't come to some arrangement. If you really beleive this is the right path, Ms Tarask, then, we who've done the same, we can't judge you for it."

---

Yukiko Date frowns at the pile of reports on her desk. "Gone, already? That shouldn't possible even with a stealth shade. You mean to say they teleported, don't you?"

Kirk Hamill nods. "It would seem they have that ability, indeed. Not that we'd be able to engage them with Squadron X still in repair."

"We built them tough, both machines and pilots, I expect they'd be ready sooner than your engineers might think. But I wasn't intending to engage the Irregulars, Hamill. That would be too much of a distraction at this critical stage. I was merely hoping to infiltrate their number, or at least bug their ships."

"Director, don't we have more more pressing matter to deal with?"

Yukiko smiles thinly. "These 'Balmarians'? We already have a lead on them, a full disclosure from one of our trusted people?"

"How did you manage that, Director?"

"It seems the Shadow Mirrors have been helping us in more ways than we thought. Kobayashi-1 was just dropped off on the Japanese mainland 12 hours ago, and immediately called in for collection. We're taking the time to fully debrief her without risk of mental shock, but her preliminary reports are quite interesting."

"I see. Seems things are finally going our way for once."

"Speaking of which, I'm going to be flying out in a few hours. I have a meeting with a certain retired Colonel, which should prove quite fruitful..."

---

*This communication technique will allow you to monitor what happens to the Zweizergain in the other world with regular reports. All you have to do is program the monitoring device in a way that leaves you satisfied I haven't tampered with it. Given your skill in making the Giest in the first place, that shouldn't be an issue for you, Mr. Yeager.*

Yeager frowns. It looks like he still hasn't gotten the right amount of sleep to be dealing with such lofty goals, but then you did sort of surprise him by teleporting in front of them as they passed Malta.

"And will the spare parts from the Giest be enough to act as this 'seed' for the new world?"

I'll need pieces from the Giest, the Zweizergain, and some of my own body, but it should be enough to start the reaction while leaving the Giest interdimensional capabilities intact, allowing you to get home as you need to.

Gilliam shakes his head. "To be able to do so much with so little... I need one more guarantee."

*Something more than just a monitor then?*

Gilliam nods. "I want to be able to destroy the Zweizergain at any point. I can't let it be abused by you or any party that gets its hands on it. A combination slave circuit and bomb, if I can install that, only then will I let it go."

---


*You look worried, Bet Barshem. Presumably the inability to contact the Neviim has you quite anxious as to your chances for retrieval.*

"I'll admit I wasn't expecting this... This isn't a simple equipment failure."

*No, the Neviims comms array has been deliberately put offline. I can't tell for certain without going into orbit, but I don't think its been attacked, so the best theory at the moment would be internal sabotage.*

"This second faction you suggested?"

*I didn't want to push the issue in front of the Irregulars, they seem suspicious of your people and probably for good reason. But yes, I think either more Balmarians have arrived in our system... Or Commander Laodiceas actions have caused a schism.*

"What do you mean by that?"

*I haven't told any of the other Shadow Mirrors about your attack on our base camp. Irm asked for an update and I said they'd been attacked but fleed intact, but was vague on the who. I don't judge you negatively for it, Vindel's loyal Shadow Mirrors are basically my enemies. But given both the political backstabbing it represents, and the military failure of your first operation, I'd imagine its made the politics among the Neviim's crew quite complex... Dangerous, even.*

"What exactly are you implying, Duminass?"

*That you can't go back as it is. And you can't stay here with the Irregulars, your nature would be too... complex for them to handle rationally. You're fresh out of options, Bet Barshem... You have to come with us.*

```

FINAL PREJUMP ROSTER

Katina and Dumi, obviously.
Tis, Lalia, and Despinis.
Latooni: Still humoring you
Seolla: Protesting less, but still isn't in favor of the trip.
Arado: Now that you've confirmed you're going, so has he.
Sophia and Wodan: Lynchpins of the plan.

Axel and Lamia: Going
Ring and Jayce: Going now that you have a way back for them
Lefina: Will go to see this new world
Tytti: Going
Bet Barshem: Dumi says she wants to come all of a sudden. Oh Well...
Coop: Has changed into his Fuck With Space-Time pants.
Dr Andrews: Going
Jamie: "Will there be chicks?"

Mech/Ship Complement:

Eurydice: Hiryu-II scout vessel
Illusion of Serenity: Highly customised Stealth Transport
R-Blade: Equipped with G-Railgun, G-Revolver, and a Tesla Drive.
Thrudgelmir: It has drills and lasery death. Still seems to be missing something, however...
Huckebien EX: It's gotten minor repairs, but the simple fact is that its missing both arms, a leg, and most of its head. The Black Hole Cannon is still there though... it's just twisted into a pretzel shape.

And the Compatible Kaiser, another Key to the Plan.
And the Eleos, Hypocrisis, and Thugater.

There is only one outstanding issue: WILL TOUMA AND SLEIGH COME WITH YOU? Touma wants to join you to ensure the Kaisers Perfect Base of Justice goes properly. Sliegh would rather wait for the Kaiser to rematerialise back in the SMVerse. You more or less have the deciding vote.

Any other issues with the roster you'd like to voice, speak now or forever hold your peace.
```
---

The G-Thundergate lifts gracefully into the air on its wide wings, as the Compatible Kaiser steps off the Kuroganes platform and into the air.

Touma calls over the comm. "Right, we're both ready!"

"He... hehe..."

"This new world will know the true meaning of justice!!""

"PHHFFHAHGAGAAHAA"

"Kaiser will rise truimphant as the symbo of What are you laughing at?"

"IT'S A FUCKING SIMURGH! You took a Simurgh, glued that BF logo over its tits, put a half-assed man-face on it and called it the Ultimate Symbol of Justice? BWAHAHAAHHAHA!!"

"Look, only the core components made the transition, Minaki didn't have a lot to work with..."

"It still has the high heels! Oh god, my sides..."

*This is merely the form Kaiser is forced to take in this universe, Katina. I assure you, if all goes to plan it'll be in its true form in the New World. Now, if everyones secured their spacesuits and strapped in... We'll begin.*

There is a sudden noise and a flash of light.


Then there is a distinct lack of noise and light.

Then you and your allies are _**Nowhere.**_

---

"Dumi, what the fuck am I seeing? What's with all the purple clouds?"

You're not really seeing anything, Katina, you mind can't really grasp the void between universes. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to begin.

Touma and Sleigh indicate readiness. "The Overgate Engine is ready, The Warrior will give you full power."

*A most impressive artifact, I can see why Dark Brain wanted it now... Ok, igniting the Seed.*

The amalgam of parts around the Kaiser begins to glow. Slowly, but surely, a bubble of some sort begin to form around the group, as the stormclouds dissipate, and show what lies behind them...

"My god, it's full of stars..."

*Very funny Katina. Those are the shards, locked into a usable formation. Now, we begin integration...*

Dumis brainlike form begins to glow even brighter than the Shards, but not with light. You look out at the whiteness of his form, as it starts to fray around the edges.

Rings voice comes over the comms from the bridge of the Eurydice. "Amazing... The calculations are so intense he has to burn up his own computing mass to make them."

The points of light representing the fragments shift, transitting across the non-sky, forming the infinitely dense pattern that is needed to prevent them destroying themselves as they merge.

*Initial calculations... complete. Touma, S-sliegh, you'll be integrating... first. Stand... by...*

The Bubble collapses, forming around the Compatible Kaiser like a golden skin. It glows with gentle light, then slowly begins to face away.

Then the Shard strikes it, and its gone.

The Shards come on all at once. One grazes the Illusion of Serenity, and it dissapears. Another slams into the Thrudgelmir, which absorbs it faster than the eye can follow. The Shards coalesce around Dumi, as his body frays after like its in a blender.

"DUUMII!!"

*It's Okay!! The New World is forming, even faster than I anticipated. Integration probability stable at 100%... But I won't be able to keep us together in the same Shard!*

"For once will you just use some fucking English!?!!?"

*...Find me, Katina. I'll be waiting for you...*

And then... You're Somewhere.
