In our last thread, Duminass began his quest to steal the Compatible Kaiser from the Irregulars and steal it away to another dimension, where he could trick another Duminass into giving it to Dark Brain while he and his friends ran off to have a queit life. However, our heroine, Katina Tarask, managed to convince him that this path was wrong, and that the only way for Dumi to be truly free was to stand up to the interdimensional tyrant, and thwart him once and for all. Forced to choose between the easy way out and doing the right thing, Dumi managed to overcome his fear of Dark Brain, and went to the Irregulars to broker an alliance...

And we picked up the Megas XLR cast. Shadow Mirror Coop is a mad scientist, Kiva a strategist and arms dealer, and Jamie is...well he's Jamie.

Anyway, we must proceed forwards! With the weekend past us, the quest continues!

Irm turns away from the bridge console and tries to shake a finger at you, but his hands are still heavily bandaged and he just ends up waving at you. "Katina...Why do you and Dumi keep going behind our backs like this?"

"Irm, Irm, it's ok! We just thought, since the Irregulars were in the area, we'd drop by and have a chat with them! They said they were going home in a little while anyway, we can hitch a ride with them, share the journey! It'll be fine."

"Katina, I'm naive, unassuming, and a sucker for a pretty face, but I'm not stupid. You two planned this whole thing from the start, you wanted to meet them! What is your game, Katina? We're supposed to be on a mission, one that could see the Shadow Mirrors winning this damned war and finally freeing the Earth! Why would you jeopardise that??"

HOW WILL YOU RESPOND TO IRM? You can trying fobbing him off or distracting him with moe-face, you could lie, or you can fill him in on your full plan and your real feelings about Vindel and Co. Or a combination.

Also, is Irm's dad along for this journey? If he is we need to work on Neo Grungust.

Irm's put up with more of our shit then anybody as of yet. He deserves to know what's going on. Though it might be in our best interest to leave out the stuff concerning Dark Brain for now, since making the fact that we may be facing an eldritch abomination in the near future common knowledge probably won't play in our favor.

"Irm...Me and Dumi, we...we don't think Vindel is the right guy for the job."

"...Huh?"

"He's an asshole! He's an egomaniac who only cares about himself! He gets off on war and death! Did you even talk to the Irregulars about what happened on their world, in the future we would have had if we'd gone there? Vindel was going to...DID use the School students, and let that bitch Setme fuck with their minds even more. He stole the Machine Cells from the Earth Cradle! He allied with the Inspectors!! And if we don't do something, our version will do the same, or worse!"

Irm looks about the bridge. Most of the consoles have been set to Dumi's control, leaving only command staff in the room. Latooni hasn't even looked up from the tactical console. Despinis watches the two of you, with her usual intense boredom. Lefina is looking at you aghast.

Irm turns back to you. "Katina...I've worked with the Shadow Mirrors for years, ever since I left PTX. I've known Vindel a lot longer than you....You're not totally wrong, he is egotistical and he's not a terribly moral person, but he has vision. He has charisma. He has experience in politics, military, intelligence, you name it. And he's the only person with all these skills who's truly devoted to getting rid of the EFA properly and remaking the world afterwards. If not him, Katina, who the hell do we turn to to fix things, and lead the fight?"

"Ourselves of course!"

"....What."

"We've worked it out! We'll go to another dimension, and get ourselves healed up, fix up a proper base, and research Sophias machine cells. Get them working properly, and we can make awesome mechs for the whole team! You'll get a Neo Grungust, I'll have this awesome red mech like a cross between the Soulgain and the Raioh, Arado will get a ninja karate thing, etc etc, and then we head back, and take on everyone! Beat the First, beat the SRX, tell Vindel to take a hike, sort out the Balmar and the DC, and the world'll be fixed! Easy!"

"...I'll repeat. What."

"The Irregulars did it! Like, Twice! Or three times, maybe."

"They changed their world?"

"Well, they saved it."

"Katina...those just aren't the same things! Killing all the 'bad mans' is never going to be enough, you'll just leave chaos in your wake! You'd end up with no power structure in the world, because there'll be no-one left to run things after you've nuked them all!"

"I thought that was Vindels plan anyway!"

"No, no, he...He wants to reinstate nation states, make everyone autonomous, so that instead of stagnating under global rule, countries are competing against one another, and driving human ambition. It's a tough job, sure, but Vindel convinced me, convinced all of us, that he could pull it off. You can't put the lie to that just because you've killed two battleships in one fight."

Tell Irm how making a world of eternal war is insane and will just end up making things worse for everyone. Bring up the point of how Seolla ended up because people wanted to make good little soldiers, and if war never stops then that'll happen to more people everywhere.

Bring up the Prisoner's Dilemma.

When groups cooperate rather than compete, everyone comes out ahead. Not to as great of a degree as if one side screwed over another, but if all sides trust and cooperate with each other then nobody gets left behind.

That means no more School. No more test dummies for the SRX project. No more sacrificing good people because of ambitions.

That's the world I want to live in.

I think Irm is already fully aware of how School subjects are unstable. Being around Katina and Latooni and all.

And I'd say Seolla bought her current condition upon herself by being obsessed with Ouka, and/or broken by her, but that's just me.

"But, Irm, I don't want that world, because...there'll be more people like me."

Irm's expression of passionate debate dissolves into one of awkwardness and discomfort.

"A world of endless conflict will just end up creating more Schools, more Project SRXs, more cyborg killers and W-series infiltrators. Peoples lives will be ruined, in the name of progress, of achievement. That world, Vindels world...it won't really be different than this one, they'll just share out the assholery between the different governments. I...can't fight for a world that runs off the misery and anguish of people like me. And I don't think you can either, Irm. You're too nice for that."

Irm lowers his gaze, hiding his eyes. "Katina...I'm trying my best, I've been trying my best for a long time now, to find a way to fix the world. But I'm just one man, I can't...I can't find the way alone."

"Then come with us, Irm, and together we'll find...no, we'll MAKE the way!"

Irm look you in the eyes, then nods. "Well, someone has to keep you from angering the natives of whatever godforsaken place we stumble into..."

Gilliam Yeager rubs his tired eyes and tries to take in everyone on the different screens at once. "Alright, so, we've all come together because we want the same things then?"

For the most part. You want security from the predations of Dark Brain: So do I. Touma and Sliegh want to free this world from the 'shackles of injustice', and I'm fairly sure the other breakaway Shadow Mirrors want much the same. I can certainly agree with that desire, and I beleive you do as well. So our issues are deal with this world, and with the threat of Dark Brain on both this and yours.

Fighter Roar cuts in. "After we've secured this world, the Warrior will have to take the Kaiser to the next, and seed Justice there as well."

I'm aware, but my nature as a multiversal entity means I tend to view things on a larger scale. The task of preserving any one world pales in comparison to preserving the multiverse at large from beings like Dark Brain.

Gilliam nods. "Its not a simple matter of beating him in battle, we managed that and he still threatened our universe. If you truly desire safety, you'll need some way to stop attacks like the one he used."

Yes...Throwing shards of broken universes into the fabric of one he cannot enter, like a archer shooting barbed arrows, distrupting the flesh of space-time. I must say, for a being of his power....it's quite a crude technique.

"You think he's capable of more finesse?"

I don't know. Being composed of pride, tyranny and terror, my master wasn't disposed to telling me how he usually acts when he loses.

Touma cuts in again. "The Warrior says some worlds are spared, others have weaknesses that leave them exposed. He does what he can to shore up the gaps, but gaps like this are always possible, and can often be overlooked."

Gilliam nods. "But in our case, we should already have plugged our gap..."

By which you mean me...

Gilliam indicates the arcane devices scattered around the command centre of the XN Giest. "I've used every technique I know to corroborate my theory, and it all checks out. The Shards were sent through to our world via the channel the Lygeus and Acqueis made. Meaning someone must have shown Dark Brain that channel, and you're the most likely suspect."

Given that I was right there in TLI throughout its construction, it would seem so. Originally, I would have simply abandoned the Shadow Mirrors before they took me into the portal, and left to find another Anti-Psychodriver to reactivate my body. It seems I would have eventually. Then we can assume Dark Brain would have contacted all the Duminass units, seeking the particular dimensional frequency of your world. I would have given him confirmation of the Lygues channel and continued my mission without thinking...wait....Actually..."

Gilliam raises his visible eyebrow. "Did something just occur to you, Duminass?"

I may be a being of vast intellect but I cannot connect all possible datapoints at once. Anyway, you've pointed out something to me: The crude nature of the attack on your world, coupled with the entry method, would mean that your time travel journey has saved two worlds, not just one.
Sciencegar Sciencebolt Mon 15 Mar 2010 19:17:06 No.4703566 Report
"You mean, the shards would have also struck this world?"

Yes, inevitably. The destruction would have been even worse than on yours, actually. The entire dimension would likely have been torn apart by the time the cracks would have become truly dangerous in yours. By channelling the shards through this world, only a fraction would have effected yours.

"But we stopped that."

Yes, it would appear so...because we're seeing the backlash of that salvation right now.

"I...don't understand."

The multiverse is an unusual place, and time is malleable here, like play-do. You can certainly change it, but there will still be marks in the material unless you knead it. You cannot simply undo something as great as the destruction of two world, Mr. Yeager. The effects are too great, something has to happen on the same scale, at some point in the fabric of reality. In our case...The Storm.

Gilliam looks at the various Scope and Screens around him, at the static buzz of probability in the Blind Infinities outside reality. "So the paradox of our having saved the two worlds is what had trapped us here."

It's trapped the XN-Giest here, at least, due to its particular method of travel. I can still leave, but the journey would be difficult, and I'd likely get lost. Other beings might actually find it easier to travel under these conditions.

Gilliam turns back to the Diamond Eye. "What about Dark Brain?"

I don't think it would stop him, slow him down, perhaps. Remember, Dark Brain technically exists in all universes anyway, except those in which he's been physically destroyed.

"So we're still safe?"

Because you technically changed the timeline of another dimension rather than your own, yes, your dimension should be unchanged as regards its accessibility to him. But the Shards...They'll be in flux, caught between the states of resting in their original worlds, and being thrown into ours. They'll be adrift on the winds of the Storm, laden with Paradox at noxious levels....

"An odd choice of words...You make it sound like they'd be poisonous."

That might not be entirely wrong...

I did three years of college-level maths. There are different scales of infinity. The Mugen punch is infinite in one dimension (lengthways), the Infinity cylinder in 4 (space and time). Once you start getting into concepts like multiverses and beings who can exist in all universes but still have Kansai accents, you're above 4. The effects of the Infinity Cylinder can take out one Dark Brain at a time, but Cobray would have to dive through every possible universe, each 4d subset of the multiverse, to get all of him.

Or at least thats my take on it. Set theory was one of my weaker subjects.

You're mid-hug on Irm when your earpiece starts twittering. You reluctantly pull away. "What is it now Dumi?"

I think we've worked it out, Katina. We have a weapon that can hurt Dark Brain, and prevent him ever getting his hands on the Compatible Kaiser. It's not perfect, but I think it's our best shot.

"AWESOME!! I told you, Dumi!! We can find a way! We can do anything together!"

Possibly, but...There are issues.

"WHY ARE YOU SUCH A FUCKING BUZZKILL??!!?"

Can I explain myself first? Please? Thank you. As I was saying, if this works, we'll be able to create a zone of perfect defense, somewhere that is totally denied to Dark Brain, where he won't be able to even think about doing bad things without getting a headache. Then we can set the Kaiser there, and it'll be forever safe from his clutches. But the downside is, if we go through with it, we...might not be able to get back.

It makes enough sense for story purposes, even if transdimensional pseudo-omniscient entities of pure evil don't exactly mesh with current schools of set theory thought.

According to Roa, Brain is infinite "as long as there is evil," but it's hard to tell if that's more superhero hyperbole or if Roa has somehow discovered measurements of Evilness that Dark Brain channels himself through.

The concept is simple. It probably shouldn't be, but since we're dealing in forces and beings defined by absolutes, simplicity tends to seep in.

We're going to create a universe.

This world will be composed of the Shards that Dark Brain was using to attack the universe of the Irregulars, that are now floating in the Paradox Storm. This will require a vast harnessing of interdimensional energy and near-infinite calculating power, but I think we can manage it. Once we create the appropriate Seed, using the Compatible Kaiser as a base, the Shards should collate into one universe.

This universe will be the ultimate paradox: It has been destroyed, many times, by Dark Brain, but is now whole. This will make it a deathtrap for him: Were he ever to enter into a place he had destroyed, the forces of paradox would tear him apart, and would likely damage his Actuality throughout the local Multiversal Clusters.

So he'll never be able to come there. And because Compatible Kaiser is the seed around which this universe is formed, it'll be the Kaisers ultimate refuge. It will be able to return to that universe at any time, preventing Dark Brain from ever gaining it for more than a moment.

But the problem lies in whats needed for the creation: The Kaiser, The XN Giests Dimensional Drives, and my Multiversal calculating power. They all have to be present when the universe is being formed...And they'll be used up in the process. The Giest will be destroyed. The Kaiser will have to be rebuilt from the materials of the new world, as in other worlds. And I'll be reduced to a personality core, enough to function as person, but deprived of my functions as an interdimensional being.

So, what I'm getting at here is...whoever is going with me...they're not getting out the same way. We'd have to hope that somewhere in the new universe there is some kind of interdimensional travelling device, or that some other traveller will enter the universe and take us out. But right now, we can't confirm any of those things. Thats the danger, that we get the perfect world we hoped for...and we're stuck there.

You look worriedly at the Diamond Eye on the conference room's screen. "D-Dumi...Are you really willing to go through with that?"

As far as I'm concerned, I gain far more than I lose. I can reconstruct myself into a new body and live normally in the new universe, and Dark Brain will never be a threat to me. I can ensure Tis, Lalia and Despinis arrive safely once the world conjoins. And we can finally be safe together. Easily worth a whole bunch of sensory organs and quantum computing ability.

"So you'd be...normal? Human?"

Perhaps. It would depend on the makeup of the universe and where I can plug in, so to speak. It's possible I'd end up as a supercomputer, a mech, a magic talking sword, a cute yellow rabbit-thing that farts lightning...the possibilities are endless. And kinda exciting too.

"And what about...our plan? The making a base, the making Machine Cells, the finding allies, and the coming back here to fix the world? Will that all have to be forgotten?"

Touma stands up, Sliegh a moment after. "Not likely! Our pact with The Warrior means that we will use the Kaiser to restore Justice on this world! If we must delay a small while to protect the Kaiser, so be it, but once it is done, Kaiser will save this Earth!"

The plan can still go ahead, Katina, but it brings with it a risk. You should be able to arrive, make your base, do whatever super-science you want. The problem is the return. Kaiser will be able to leave, but it travels alone, accompanied only by The Warrior. You have two options: Either we hope that the universe contains the possibility of interdimensional travel, or we delay the plan until we can find another way to enter and leave it. I think that's a choice everyone who'd going with us will have to make themselves...

WILL KATINA DECIDE NOW, OR GET THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS?

"I'm sorry its working out this way Irm, but Dumi...he's got to do this thing. It sorts out him, his friends, the Irregulars, and it'll end up keeping us safe too. I didn't...I wouldn't force you to choose again if I could help it."

Irm looks down the room as Kusuha and her colleagues once again prepare the patients for moving. "Naw, I don't blame you or anything. It's just the way it worked out. And besides, you've helped me to think, maybe that the Shadow Mirrors weren't the best place for me to be, that it was just because I was stuck at TLI and had nothing better to occupy my mind, that I ended up buying into Vindel's ideals...Looking after these folks, while you're gone, that'll be enough of a challenge for me, I think."

Gilliam looks genuinely angry at this point, but whether its from lack of sleep or actual issues he's having, you can't say. "I...I caused all of this. If it weren't for my own short-sighted attempts to travel the dimensions, our two worlds would never have been threatened this way at all! What's happened here, the chaos its generated, the lives that have been lost...These things prove that Interdimensional Travel is a Bad Idea. I don't want to give you the Acqueis system, Ms Tarask, because I don't think you'll do anything good with it. You'll invade this new world, then invade your own with the weapons you find, back and forth like a wrecking ball...Would that really help your world? At the end of it all, would it have been worth it? I don't think so."

Gilliam turns away from the screen as he finishes. "Besides, I need the Zweizergain to make sure Duminass keeps his side of things. Then I intend to destroy it, like I did before. Expect maybe with more explosives this time, to make doubly sure. And that, will finally, be the end of the madness I created."

"Yeah yeah yeah. Can't you help me convince Gilliam to help us more? The Irregulars can't just abandon us after all this stuff! Can't they see we need their help as much as their world does?"

Sleigh steps into the room, arms crossed over her pink breastplate. "...The Irregulars seem to be divided. The younger, more spirited among them wish to fight Injustice, as and when they see it, regardless of the world it lies in. But the older ones, they fear that if they intervene here, they'll do more harm than good. They talk about the destruction at TLI, the EFA's mobilisation of troops, the distruption from the constant attacks they've suffered since they got here...They worry that they've made everything worse for us. Their reluctance to help is as much shame for their failings as it is selfishness."

"But, can we convince them?"

Touma claps his fist into his palm. "We don't need their help! Not with the Warrior and the Kaiser on our side! I still say we go with them, and forge the new Kaiser which will rid the Multiverse of evil!"

"And I still say we're better off waiting for it to return! Just because we won't have Warrior's support and my armor, doesn't make us any less the Warriors of Justice! We can still find a way to fight, while the Kaiser returns to us!"

An interesting idea. The people Gilliam is most likely to listen too are probably the old agressors.

Taking to Sanger with the angle of giving warrior's of juctice a car may work although it may also backfire and we're better going through the ATX team particularly Bullet.

Ratsel would need a calmer approach possibly somthing along the lines of giving allies to the warrior who can aid him when he needs might tickle his fancy if enough quiet determination is thrown in. Influencing him from lower down probably isn't possible he likely will not fall for that.

Kai strikes me as a pure facts kind of man so I'll leave him to someone else.

Hey guys, not to go off on a tangent, but a thought occurs. Since we're going to be going into an all-new universe, why not populate it with new material? That is, rather than doing a traditional SRW-verse, why not instead make all the populations the various /m/ Originals? We have plenty of mechs both supers and reals to choose from - ENIS, Kerykeions, the Space Murderzord, the list goes on. Let Sciencegar take whatever mechs, groups, and ideas he likes from all the various crap we've churned out over the years, and make a world that really is new.

So try to think of a way to convince Gilliam to stop indulging in his own selfish desire to ignore his responcibilitys as System XN's creator and to make sure it goes to people who will use the system for good.

On the subject of such Roar's consiousness is seperate to Touma's right? If so I would like to know his thoughts on the matter (word for word from Touma if need be). Roar refusing to hide the kaiser at the expence of those who risk their lives to protect it when there is a way to give the group a backup plan for escape.

The above works in-character since no-one knows what kind of world will be thrown together and it could be a nightmare of all the evils of several dimensions without the heroes of those worlds to help.

Does this mean I have to design three more mechs...?

>>4705679
My general argument against using existing series is twofold. First, we've seen these before. A lot of what we want, from the previous lists that have been made, has either already been in SRWs or is too young to be put in one. And I wouldn't feel nearly as comfortable dicking with show/movie continuity as I do with the Banpresto Originals, or Sciencegar's twisted Shadow-Mirror takes on them. A lot of /m/ Originals have underdeveloped casts, there's a lot more maneuvering room to be had.

Second, also based on the previous lists, a lot of our recommendations to date have been based around settings with god tier mechs that we have no business fighting, and -absolutely- no business acquiring for ourselves. Demonbane, Getter, so on - Sciencegar would be a fool to even let us get near having any of these, and he's no fool. It's just not going to happen, so at -best- we can end up just not seeing any of these mechs. At worst, we fight them and die instantly, no save. I'd rather stay away from putting us in that kind of situation.

Gilliam's thing is basically the newest iteration of his old guilt from what he did in Hero Senki, and we probably won't get it to go away in a hurry. It doesn't matter how much we hit him, he got RIDER KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICKed into trying to avoid stuff like this. We are not more powerful than Black RX.

Plus we need him to run the Zweizergain so we don't all get lost as soon as we try to jump. Forcing him aboard is not going to do us any favours, he'd be more than willing to just strand everyone including himself in the gap of dimensions rather than let it free. He's not entirely wrong, either, dimensional travel is pretty much universally a bad idea. The only person who's had it work out completely for them so far is Cobray, and he just hasn't been kidnapped and brainwashed by a mad scientist yet.

Honestly, our best bets are to jump and pray Cobray shows up to give everyone a ride rather than try to convince Gilliam. Maybe if by some amazing chance we find Hero Senki's Elpis and he has a chat with ZEUS he can get over the guilt, but then he might want to stay there. And, you know, the chances of that are even less than Cobray showing up.

Couch returns with more mech designan.

Lanius: Coop isn't known for being a low-key mecha designer. When offered the opportunity to design a mech for the resident zombie cyborg, the resulting grin was enough to make Dark Brain shudder from universes away. Lanius is an absolute beast, a close-combat real-type designed to take maximum advantage of Arado's enhanced body. The unit is capable of speeds that would kill a normal human, using a Direct Motion Link system to give it unmatched proficiency in close combat. Streamlined and organic in appearance, a far cry from the R-Blade on which it was based, Lanius is armed with miniaturized gravicons in its arms and legs that add immense power to its punches and kicks, growing even stronger when the outputs of all four gravicons are concentrated into the right leg for a Maximum Graviton Kick. Like the Soulgain, Lanius draws energy from Arado's emotions, turning his rage into surges of even greater power.

When fists are not enough, Lanius is well-armed - its hips carry a pair of Eclipse Calibers, drastically enhanced Blade Tonfa which can be switched between tonfa and Graviton Rifles. In addition to this, it rides a large surfboard craft shaped like a stag beetle, including a giant scissor claw on the front which can be used as a massive Rider Crusher, a variant on the G-Sword Diver attack.

Katina....We don't even know if they're prisoners anymore, and if they are, that doesn't mean they're at Izu Base. The Kurogane probably didn't head straight back there, it could easily dropped them off at any number of SRX-aligned bases on the way. And since even I can't track this worlds Kurogane, it was only thanks to comm-signal triangulation from both my scans of the Giest and Lalias of the Hiryu that we found this one, we have no way of knowing which bases its visited. I can make educated guesses, no more.

"Dumi, can you think of any way to convince Gilliam? He can't simply abandon us in the new world while he has the Zweizergain!"

I rather think Mister Yeagers intent is that you not come with me at all, Katina. He seems to have a bad view on interdimensional travel as a whole, likely due to harsh experience. He probably thinks you should solve the problems with this world without resorting to 'abusing' the infinite resources of the multiverse.

"But we can't! We barely got away from Vindel with three firecrackers worth of firepower! We aren't going to solve shit like this! We need to get away, make the Machine Cells, gather our forces. We can't do that here!"

I don't know, there are potentially a few ways, but they require making alliances with people you don't see eye-to-eye with, like the Balmarians, or the ELF. But there are still potential alternatives. There are still two interdimensional signals we haven't accounted for, the one in Izu Base, and the one in space, which will be in Earth Orbit within the next few hours. Or we can risk a sidetrip.

"What, like go to a totally other dimension to find someone who can pick us up from the new world?"

Essentially. That's not without risk of course, since it requires navigating the Storm for at least two full trips while its still raging, and while I can narrow our search down to a world with an interdimensiona traveller in it, theres no guarantee they'd be powerful enough to help us, or if they are, that they'd be inclined to help. Gilliam is unlikely to be alone in his opinions, Katina.

The Eurydice and the Illusion of Serenity are fully capable of breaking atmo, and Dumi has his transport form as well. The issue would be doing it stealthily: The Illusion has Stealth capability, but its not a PT transport and has space for one mech at most. Between it and Dumi you could make it with your mech complement, (which includes the 3 Combat Puppets, no longer restricted by disguises), but the Eurydice would likely have to stay behind for the duration of the trip.

I'm tempted to say at lest make a flying visit to B since Sciencegar went to all the trouble to make them we might at least have a talk with them... and I think Dumi wants to go have a look too, he seems to be dropping hints.

Unless going would put the rest of our plan at risk. What if they're able to keep us from doing the rest of our plan if they didn't like us... if they have the power and the inclination then staying and doing anything else would be a bad idea too.

The RyuKoOh isn't hard to find, but Bullet and Kusuha are nowhere to be seen. You look about, and almost bump into another pair of pilots.

"Oh, hi, er, have you see-"

"Ohhhhh, aren't you just the most precious thing! Kyosuke, can we keep her?"

"I don't see how that'd be appropriate, Excellen..."

"Please? We'll leave the one we have already in a good home, and take her back with us."

"That's...not funny."

You cough lightly for attention. "Um, I flattered and all, but I was just looking for Bullet and Kusuha, I was hoping to ask them about our problem, maybe get some advice..."

The man called Kyosuke frowns slightly deeper than usual. "What problem, exactly?"

"Well, that we need a way to get back from the New World if we're going to go there! It's not fair that you get your world saved from everything bad, but ours is still up shit creek!"

"It's not a question of fairness, Ms Tarask, it's a question of consequences. Fooling around with the entire universe is a risky business without a whole lot of payoff. Most of the time, the odds don't work out. You're talking about going to another world just to get away from the problems you have here, but you're just swapping one hand for another. We saw Vindel try that, and he lost everything."

"Dammit, you're all so self-righteous! We're not Vindels cronies anymore! We're not looking for escape or power, we're trying to save the world. It's no different from what you're doing here!"

"No, frankly, it isn't. If we hadn't come here and stopped Vindel from coming, our entire universe, not just our planet, would be completely gone. If you lose, there's still an earth. There's still a human race that can sort themselves out. Theres still a future you can work to improve."

"Kyosuke..."

The sadness on Excellens face is a terrible mirror to her earlier cheer. You have to suppress the urge to hug her.

"From what I saw before, when I touched that mans mind...Maybe there wouldn't be a future..."

"I...The details aren't very important, but we were able to learn a little something about the Einst of this world, and how they're different from ours."

"Bullet and Kusuha told me they were just monsters, they'd pop out of nowhere and start killing shit. Our dudes are all subtle and shit, hiding in plain sight. Like, ninja tentactle monsters."

"From what I...gathered, they're a weaker strain of what we faced. An offshoot that had to leave their home dimension before the real Einst ate them for being weak and unworthy. They came to your world long ago, and they've been trying to make it...safe."

"Safe? By taking it over?"

"Kinda. They're incredibly paranoid, it seems, and want to be completely safe here on Earth. That means they've been changing themselves to fit Earths environment, and assuming human form to try to take over. They want humanity to stop fighting, to just become passive and docile, so they can live here forever."

"Thats...awful!"

"It's a horrible thing to do, I know, but its their-"

"No, I mean its the worst idea ever! Humans will never just sit on their asses and let mutant gribblies run the world for them! The DC, the ELF and the Shadow Mirrors are proof enough of that, and they didn't even know about the Aliens when they started. This is just like that Juergens guy and his retarded Brain Internet, it just couldn't work!"

"I didn't finish...They know this too, Katina. Making the EFA was just their first step. Now that they've solidified their power, they're starting to accelerate the process of changing...and to reverse it."

"The which? The Changing of...them turning into people...reversed...Oh FUCK!!"

Kyosuke grimaces. "It'd take hundreds of years, just like the first step, and there'd be plenty of hiccups along the way. But slowly, inevitably, the Einst and the Humans would both dissappear, leaving just one race. The First and Only..."

Gilliam's done this way more than once and it's never really gotten him anywhere. At best dimensional travel got him to the semi-decent OGverse after god knows how long wandering, and he didn't even want to get there in the first place, he just wanted to go home. So at best dimensional travel doesn't get you your goals, at worst it unleashes evil people on all worlds instead of just one.

Based on his own personal experience, yes. But that's JUST his personal experience. Gilliam isn't omniscient. And even had he never made use of dimensional travel, would the places he went to really have been better off? Without Gilliam, would the OG universe possibly been able to fend off the Aerogaters, for instance? Just because things didn't go as Gilliam intended doesn't mean that the dimensions he traveled to were worse off for his attempts.

The problem with Gilliam's logic is that it's based on the success or failure of his intended goals. However, it doesn't change the fact that in almost all of the places where Gilliam travelled to, his presence had a net positive effect, no matter that it was different from his original intent.

Gilliam is essentially condemning dimensional travel based on his own personal failings and inabilities. It's not the case that dimensional travel is inherently a bad thing, but that Gilliam's own hubris and bad decisions made it work poorly for him.

That is meta knowledge, although we could easily ask someone of the OGnumbers (Kyosuke now even) about the good Gilliam has done within their world.

Perhaps also ask if he would damn Lamia to an unknown fate if he could easily give her a backup plan. Dimensional travel was the reason she found the ATX team after all.

After all Gilliam has already modified system XN to be untraceable once hell they could lock the Zweizergain's system XN to be unable to enter the OG universe and thats still a win. Could even add in there that the OGverse is all Gilliam seems to care about rather than using dimensional travel for Justice(tm).

Indeed. Guilliam seems to be implying that OG no Sekai is the only one that matters. More to the point, sooner or later someone else is going to make some way of crossing dimensions. Hell, besides the XN Geist, there's Dumi, Euzeth's Cross Gate Paradigm System, whatever those three people Euzeth was scamming earlier were using... ETC. He can't ensure that no one will ever use dimension travel again. What he can do is try to ensure that if it IS used it gets used for good purposes.

But he can't. He might not be able to stop anyone else from inventing this, and he can't track down everyone from across all the universes to make sure no one is inventing it ever. All he can try to do is at least stop System XN from being misused, and the best way to do that is to destroy it once and for all.

It's not selfish, you guys aren't listening. You don't know what will happen with dimensional travel, and it pretty much always turns into the law of unintended consequences writ large. It sucks to get abandoned, but it's better that at least one universe get saved instead of putting more and more at risk because you're blind to the consequences of bringing justice to everyone. When in this entire quest have we even managed to save our universe? And now we want to try to use dimensional travel to fix our own mistakes, without thinking of what bigger evils we could unleash?
