Apologies for the long delay, but I had to do actual real-life things, and this shit was eating up my nights, hard.

We're still going to be taking it relatively slowly, at a few posts a day, because frankly you people tire me out with your constant demands to have Katina rape things. Isn't that was Haken Browning is for?

TL:DR You are RPing as the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask. You are equally as filled with rage as your counterpart, but concentrated into smaller timeframes, allowing you to trick people with Moe periods before your true form is revealed. The heroes of the OGverse have travelled back in time and crossed dimensions in order to prevent Dark Brain destroying their universe from the outside, this has put a major downer on your plans for the next few weeks, but has also allowed you another chance to make Arado your pet slave (the first one doesn't breath anymore).

Harken, get on the Katina rapefic! I'll join in as soon as Beowulf starts Einstifying any attractive males!

In general: I wanted to mention this last time, but we need to keep these two new guys from finding out we have Arado at all costs. They'll probably want him back, and we just can't have that.

Dramatis Personae

Katina Tarask: Ex-School trainee, psychotic, and working her way to the top of the sex offender registry.
Irm Kazahara: Gullible leader of the team, still falls for your moe routine despite seeing what you're really like multiple times. Thinks he's in charge.
Russel Bagman: Hard-working Irishman, sensible but unable or unwilling to try to stop Katina.
Latooni Subota: Cold, calculating School graduate, joined Shadow Mirror for unknown reasons. Won't put out for some reason.
Ibis Douglas: Gun nut and artillery specialist, seeking lost friend Sleigh.
Johnathan Kazahara: Last survivor of Tesla-Liecht Institute, mostly silent so far.
Rio Mei Long: Hard-working multitasking engineer and pilot.
Ryoto Hikawa: Engineer, Shadow Mirror loyalist and mostly useless, at least to Katina.
Kai Kitamura: Former EFA ace who dissappeared, and then showed up as you fled TLI. Allegiance unclear, but seems to be on your side for now. Is pretty much leader at this point. Has a sexy, sexy eyepatch.
Dumi: Dynamic Unlimited Military Intelligence, support AI for the DGG-04. Has been incredibly helpful to you so far, maybe too helpful...
Arado Balanga: Looks like your best friend who you accidentally rage-killed when he went out with another woman. Claims to be one of the warriors from another dimension thats causing the crisis, but you haven't ruled out the Ghost Returned From Hell To Punish You theory.

God dammit this! Unfortunately Ryuune is in talks with them right now so if she was to mention him, and as we seem to be on our way to friendly terms with them right now we might have trouble keeping him.

Others of Note:

Vindel Mauser: Leader of Shadow Mirrors and pilot of the interdimensional super robot Zweizergain. Last seen dissappearing in a flash with Lemon Browning and a tiger-Grungust from the other world. Apparently, these newcomers are looking for him.
Axel Almer: Head of Shadow Mirror military forces, and foe of EFA ace Beowulf. You were seperated from him while fleeing from TLI. You were meant to meet up with him in California, but he hasn't been heard from since.
Ryuune Zoldark: One of the few remaining leaders in the near-defunct Neo Divine Crusaders. Chirpy, loves your dress sense, but you sense a cold political mind behind it all. Granted you asylum despite the risk, but you doubt it'll be for free.
Ratsel Fienschmecker and Sanger Sombold: Two of the newcomers, negotiating with Ryuune for an alliance of some sort.

Current Mech Roster:

2 Gespensts, one red for Ibis which is laden with guns, one blue for Russel which is using Blade Tonfas salvaged from your wrecked R-Blade.
The Assault Lander, a massive tank based off the Grungust series, piloted by Irm.
Rai-oh: A prototype super robot of some description, meant to kick things to death. Currently piloted by you, to the concern of the rest of the team, but the LIOH system registered itself to you, so they don't have much choice.
DGG-04: Currently without an official name, this transforming motorbike is a support mech for the Rai-Oh, with multiple systems to defend other mechs and lend supporting fire. Piloted by/is Dumi.

You're sitting on guard duty, as the meeting between sides continues, when Irm and Kai finally return to the Trilobite. Everyone dismounts from their mechs and gathers round to hear the news.

Irm seems to be expecting Kai to start, but eventually speaks up himself. "Ok, basically, Ms Zoldark has agreed to help the newcomers to find certain things they're looking for, in particular, the Zweizergain. In return, they...well, she was vague on that score, probably on purpose, so she has leverage on them in the future."

"Wait, so they're together now? Does that mean she'll give them back Arado?"

Kai shakes his head. "She's not stupid, she knows a bargaining chip when she sees one. They even mentioned that they had several pilots missing after their arrival here, and she said she knew nothing on that score. Hopefully they didn't see Irm squirm in his boots when the topic came up."

"H-hey! I just...don't think keeping him locked up is going to benefit us long-term."

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, we have another bridge to cross."

Latooni nods. "We have to figure out what part we will play in all of this..."

Yeah, we need some sort of overarching goal besides running away while raping and killing as many people as possible. Do we want to help the newcomers or not? We don't really want to fight them, we'd get our asses kicked. If we don't help them, we need to do something to avoid just becoming bit players while the newcomers and the EFA fight it out.

I'm kind of with teaming up with the DC to stop the humans fighting each other so we can beat the shit out of some aliens and reserve the humans for the harem.

Kai lays out the DCs side of things: "Ryuune will grant us fully asylum here at the base, but only on the condition we fully join the DC and hand over all of our mechs, so that if the EFA come calling for us she can stick to her Californian Asylum strategy. Obviously, thats the safe and boring option, unless someone finally decides to wipe out this shithole of a base."

"Otherwise, we're essentially renting ourselves out as mercaneries for the DC, and doing some of Ryuunes dirty work. She gave us a few options on that regard: We can go back with the two newcomers and support their operation to break out of the EFA blockade around TLI-"

Irm nearly shits a brick. "No way!! We'll be recognised as the ones who captured Arado! We might as well give ourselves up to the EFA!"

Kai sighs. "I'm just giving all the options Irm. Her other suggestion was to start the big search, looking for these targets the newcomers want found, she had a list of a few places to try."

Latooni again looks up from her datapad. "Then there is the option to go it alone."

"Yes. We trade Arado and his mech for fuel, maintenance and other supplies, then head out into the world as free agents, and do whatever the hell we like in a world thats about to break into war like never before."

CHOICES? OPINIONS? ALTERNATE PLANS? MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THESE PLANS? SEEK MORE INFO? OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR THE OPINIONS OF THE OTHERS?

I'm not too sure that we should be striking out on our own as we are now. Maybe if we had a few more men and mecha, but for now we're far too weak to be an independant faction. Perhaps we should gather some information first?

Kai chips in first. "If we can convince Ryuune to hand over Arado now, we should be able to keep buddy-buddy with the new guys for now, and join up with any surviving Shadow Mirrors stuck in the EFA cordon. I think sticking close to these new guys is our best bet, if we want to be moving and shaking in this new war."

Irm rubs his chin completatively. "Well, that might work...But getting into fighting as tough as what they're going to be doing? I don't like the sound of that. I like the idea of working with Ryuune more, working this mercanery angle."

Russel pipes up. "I don't like the idea of jumping the bonfire either. I say we join this search of hers. Little bit of intelligence gathering with the odd skirmish with the EFA, sounds like the good old days again."

Ibis speaks up meekly. "I....I just want to find my friend. I'll stay with you guys if I can, but as free agents, we can stay away from the war, and get our lives back into shape, somehow."

Johnathan looks up sleepily from his toolbox. "Frankly son, I think we should stay put, for now at least. California's nuetrality lets us keep ourselves out of the mess until things blow over, then we can see what we have left to rebuild from."

Joining the DC wouldn't be a horrible option. It's not like they can use our Dynamic Generals without us anyway.

Going with the Newcomers is also a good option. If someone recognizes us as the ones who captured Arado, we say "That's war. Give us back our dad."-style crap and tell them to suck it up when we give Arado back.

Rio thinks about what's been said. "If we're going to find any of the remaining Shadow Mirrors, we should either work with the DC or the new guys to find them. Going it alone is too much of a task."

Ryoto draws himself up, like he were actually macho or something. "If we really are the last of the Shadow Mirrors though, then we owe it to Mauser-sama to follow his legacy, to make humanity stronger through adversity! We should go with the newcomers and help them wreck the EFA!"

A metallic voice comes over the tannoy. Observing the situation, I've come to the conclusion that our best interests are served by being independent agents. The DC are desperate for military strength and political ammunition, hence this alliance. We will be destroyed for Ms Zoldarks ambitions if we let her manipulate us. And the newcomers have little reason to trust us even if we return their pilot. Independence allows us mastery of our own fate.

Latooni puts her datapad away. "The optimal strategy is to ally with the DC, and lend support to the winning side as needed to manipulate world events as desired. However, that merely maximises survival chances. If we take the risks as free agents, our position and knowledge of events would make us much more potent than our military power alone would suggest. Either option allows for...interesting tactical options."

All eyes turn to you...

Split my vote between the DC and going independent. Personally, I think if we go independent, we'll need to find a means of snatching up a large number of mechs, pilots, and supplies.

Ask the rest of the group if they have any knowledge of locations where we could find a cache of supplies, or where we could "liberate" some.

"W-well, first things first...we need more troops! We can't make any decision until we have our maximum power. Then we can be the hot new unit that everyone wants on their side!!"

Kai smirks and rubs his eyepatch. "Not the worst suggestion...but with the EFA crackdown at the level it is, finding a bunch of mechs lying around is no trivial matter."

Irm nods. "Yeah. With Mao Industries essentially run by the EFA, Itsurugi and TLI were essentially the only other places producing mechs on any scale, and they've both been bombed out of existence now."

Russel pipes up. "Well, we can still try the ELF in Europe. They might be beat up, but they still have some ability to make mechs."

"Getting to Europe requires flying through the US, which is not a good option if we want to avoid fighting." Points out Kai.

Again, Latooni chimes in, with a queit but attention-drawing voice. "But it is possible with an alternate route. If you recall, there was a Shadow Mirror unit headed south, intent on reaching our supply base in Brazil. We could meet up with them and cross to Africa, and from there meet up with the ELF or Van Trans Neo-DC forces."

Johnathan frowns. "Well, its either that, or we start asking what few EOTI goons who haven't been killed or taken by the EFA if they have any prototypes lying around..."

I did forget to mention this. Unfortunately, as you are, you don't have the resources to do this kind of upgrade, not with your three engineers anyway. However, the DC could do it quite handily. The plan seemed to be to hand it over to them to fix, and work out who owned it later.

I feel I should point out, Arado is still in the DC's medical bay under their guard. It's not a matter of just taking off right now and worrying about fuel later: You're going to have to ask for him back.

They proceed to become recurring villains for the next few chapters, until some kind of twist happens and they see we are not as evil as they thught. We join forces and we now have a badass battleship.

As for the SRWW storyline....Well, I really don't know it that well, and it has compatability issues to say the least. While I'm not opposed to a ship full of adventurers flying through the Solar System as a plot point, said ship being the key to the secrets of the universe might not be what I had in mind.

Also, I'm a total fag for linking similar ideas together, so if I do write in the Database, the Akashic Record will be shoved in there somewhere. My warped interpretation of it, at least.

"Well, I guess, we stay with the DC for now, but mostly independent. Then, once we recruit a few more people, we can re-evaluate the situation."

With the others fairly evenly divided, Katinas vote is the tie-breaker. You, Kai and Irm head back over to finalise the details with Ryuune.

As you enter the house, you see the two newcomer men, seemingly in discussion with a blonde woman in a Troye Unit uniform. You make your excuses to the others, and head over to get the measure of the newcomers.


"...Uncannily like him." The blonde woman is a ravishing 18-year-old beauty, with her long hair tumbling over her shoulders and obscuring half of her face. "I don't see how such a resemblance could be merely accidental."

"Well, Ms Garstein," says Ratsel, "I'm afraid I couldn't enlighten you on the probability of these kinds of things, but rest assured, I am not your cousin, and I certainly wasn't involved in the Massacre at Elpis or the EFAs purging of colony leaders. So I'm afraid you must be mistaken."

Leona inclines her head. You can't see it clearly with all the hair, but you imagine her making some kind of quizzical pout, before walking off down the corridor, slowly.

"And who do we have here?"

The silver-haired man turns to you.

"Are you another DC pilot, miss?"

Well, as I see it, the EFA have their fleet, if there are any UCC remnants left they'll have theirs. The DC is unlikely to have any as they relied on the UCC for the first war, and the Inspectors in the second. The Shadow Mirror have Trilobites, which really are much more awesome than I've been making them out to be once they have a proper crew. Beyond that the only real options are the Valstork, which presents the problem of getting to deep space to meet them, and an original (see above).

"What was that all about?" Asks Kai as you walk in.

"Nothing I want to talk about." You throw yourself down into a chair in a huff.

"You're just in time, Katina." Ryuune smiles across the deck. "Our people have been checking things out, and it seems we'll be able to fund your little adventure after all."

She points to the globe at the side of her desk. "We need to find Vindel Mauser and double-check the presence of any alien entities on the planet. There are a couple of ways you could go about this. The first is the plan your team suggested, heading to Africa via Brazil to meet Van Tran. His faction split away from the DC to join with the Inspectors, so he's the most likely to have info on any remaining alien presence. This route also makes it easier for you to crew your ship, since you'll be meeting up with Unit W, who should have the expertise."

Her finger travels around to the Pacific. "The next option would be to island-hop through the Pacific and make it to Hawaii. The Naval College there is the biggest source of trained EFA starship crew, and starship crew dropouts, on the planet, and with the help of our agents, you should be able to crew your ship and head to Adoneius Island."

"The EOTI?" Irm raises an eyebrow. "The EFA bombed that place flat after the first DC war."

"Exactly. It's been bombed flat, but underneath the island, there are still some chambers intact. Our contacts imply there is some activity still going on there. It's not a definite lead, but its somewhere we'd like checked out anyway."

"And finally, there's an odd report we recieved within the last hour or so. Someone claiming to be the legendary scientist Helios Olympus made himself known to our spy network, claiming he knew something about the newcomers and had 'men and materiele' available for our use. The contact point he gave us was in northern Canada, a bit out of the way but a good stepping-off point for going to Europe, if that's your destination. And assuming he's legitimate."

Kai turns to you. "Well Katina, you're our random outburst generator. Where do you say we go?"

Ratsel takes his hand of Arado's mouth as the boy finally calms down. "Oh thank god you're here, Mr. Finesmacker. I thought I was going to die in here, or have horrible things done to me, or get my mind broken, or-"

"Quiet! Arado, you have to listen to me, things are getting very complicated very fast. Its not going to be as simple as you think."

"What? Well, um, how hard can a breakout be? You're the Mystery Gourmet, don't you have your ninja cooking skills to flambe us a way out of here or-"

"I can't get you out of here Arado. Not because of the frankly laughable security, but because it would jeopardise the mission."

"HUH?!!??!"

"SSSSSHHHH!!!! Arado, you're being held prisoner by the DC, one of the few factions on this world that is willing to work with us. We need every ally we can get or else we risk Vindel trying to get away and bringing Dark Brain down on us. If I break you out of here, that vital alliance will be broken, and we could have risked this whole trip for nothing."

Arado looks on verge of tears. "So you're just going to leave me here? With...with HER??"

"Not quite. First, I'm giving you this earplug comm device. It's partially faded out of this dimension, so it should be undetectable. You'll still be in contact with us. Secondly, I'm giving you a mission."

"A mission?"

"This version of Ryuune Zoldark is quite the politician, and seems to like the art of deal-making quite a bit. If you approach her the right way, and try to make yourself useful to her, she may just make a deal with you to get you out of the chair. You'd still be stuck in the DC, but you'd be free to report on their activities for us. It's vital they don't get to hide any info from us. Please Arado, it's for the good of our entire world!"

"....Ok, but you have to promise me..."

"Yes?"

"...that you won't let Seolla kill me for what might happen."

You mean in-game or in-universe?

In-universe it could destroy an entire planetary defense force on its lonesome and most of Bian's original plan was to shove it between earth and the aliens. It's not really in the same class as Cybuster, because while it outpowers normal Cybuster pretty hard, Masaki has literal godhax on his side if things get desperate enough. It's probably considered to be more "powerful" (however you want to define that) in-universe, though gameplay mechanics fuck with that pretty hard.

Basically it's super badass.

"I don't feel like anything too complicated right now. Lets just go to Brazil, and Africa and shit."

"Very well." Ryuune stands up. "We'll get your equipment all sorted ASAP, so we can have you moving before the EFA finally come looking for you.

The next few hours are spent under lamplight, as the sun goes down and you work through the night to get your preperations finished. You don't even get to see the two newcomer DGGs leave.

The Trilobite is stripped down and restocked, the hangar cleared of large amounts of padding, scaffolding, and unneeded equipment that had been thrown in with the DGGs. The mechs are packed back in a better configuration, the Raioh sitting atop the transformed DGG-04 to better conserve space.

THE DGGS NOW ONLY TAKE UP 2 SLOTS IN HANGAR. WITH THE A-LANDER AND 2 GESPENSTS, THAT LEAVES 3 SLOTS FREE.

Just before midnight, you have everything finished and are ready to leave, when Ryuune comes up to the group, with an unrestrained Arado in tow.

"Good news! I've found another pilot for you! Arado wants to help find the missing MacGuffins so bad, he's willing to turn himself over to your command again, Irm."

"That's not...I'm perfectly willing to wait here, do some chores, clean the toilets for you..."

"Ah, but you said you were burning with hotblooded desire to find what you needed and return home victorious. Why would I waste your talents in a lazy place like this?"

"Er, well, I gues-"

"Don't worry, I'm sure the Final Shadow Mirrors will treat you very well. Won't you, Katina?"

Arado turns ghostly white at your grin.

They are trying to work out how it works. I doubt it will be available for a while.

Anyway, we have 3 slots, right?

Latooni, Kai and Arado are the most skilled pilots that lack mechs as of now, so I say we ask for a Gespent, a Guarlion and a Schutzwald for Kai, Arado and Latooni respectively.

Kai and Gespents are like bread and butter, Arado is pretty darn skilled in high speed battles as shown when he sheds the WildWurger's armor and Lat has experience in hartillery units so she should fit nicely.
