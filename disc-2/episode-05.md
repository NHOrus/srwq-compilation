Last time on Disc 2, we actually managed to get some plot done, as our heroine
Katina Tarask found another survivor from a slightly more compatible world, and
managed to get a cryptic message from her lost partner Dumi. However, while she
was drinking away her sorrows, an unusual black mech appeared and began
strolling through the city, as if searching for something. Our inebriated
heroine immediately went to get her mech...

(Repost from end of last thread, because I totally forgot how near we were to
autosage)

You run along the street, with Akane right behind you, chasing the mech and the
mad elf. The Arcus easily outpaces you all, plodding through the streets of
Edo, smashing windows and popping street lights, but little else. It
occasionally sends light from its eyes into larger buildings, apparently
scanning them for something. Sirens blare across the city, and what few people
were on the streets make for cover. The city seems to have a good number of
shelters and secure structures to take cover in.

The things walks on, up to G-Force HQ. Its scan-beams pass over it, and linger
a while longer than the other buildings, but then it walks over, knocking over
several walls as it goes. You reach the HQ a minute later, overtaking an out-
of-breath Nozumi.

A large man wearing at least 3 belts of grenades leads the G-Force Security
Team to secure the grounds. "Ready all explosives! If it comes back this way,
fire everything! And if you die, curse those cheapskates in the army for not
giving you bigger guns!"

You ignore the lightly armed guards and head over to the R-Blade, which is now
standing in the yard. Saotome hops down from the cockpit. "I've gotten it
warmed up for you. Sure you're fit to fly it?"

"'m too drunk to answers that kestion wi'out bias."

"...I'm sure you'll do fine."

The R-Blade boots up, and turns to face the black mech, which is headed to the
city centre, and the few skyscrapers in this old-timey city. Your radar
registers planes and tanks coming from the north.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

I just mentioned this in thread 4 without noticing 5 had arrived - I'd like to
bring up the possibility that the "bad CGI" effect this thing supposedly has is
because it actually -is- CGI - a virtual object manifested into reality.

Then we lead the military to fight the tanks.

Ask it if it can surrender

if it attacks, we aim for its cockpit, and shoot at it.

If it was, it wasn't our Giado. It was probably an alternate version of him now
that I think about it though... the accent, being "colored" and being an
"Unfamiliar Familiar Face" kind of attest to that.

I'm replayin OG1 right now, so even Giado and Garnet are fresh in my mind.

Is there any chance we can get a full crew listing so that we know who were
looking for on our new frontier planet?

You flip open your comms and hiccup. "Ugh, yeah, you, black dude, dude in the
black mech...S'rrend'r."

It doesn't respond. It seems to be walking past the main commercial district,
and is now headed north, towards the military force.

"YO! FUCKWAD! YOU TALK TO ME OR IMMA STUFF THESE TONFINGS UP YER ASS!!"

"Dimensional significant, are you the source of signals #3829 and #3843?"

"Huh? Shaddap about my signals, you have to surrender!"

"Probability raised to 47%. Moving to analyse."

The black thing, like a picture of a mech painted over the world, turns back
towards you. A sort of wireframe appears in its hands, then fills in with
light, and the thing is now carrying two ornate blades.

"Submit to full scan or combat analysis will become nessecary."

"Nessecary? I'm Katina Tarask, its fuckin' mandatory!!!"

You take off and boost forward, tonfas drawn.

we better do it since we are in an inferior machine and that thing is huge, aim

dodging and request fire support oh also contact akane im sure she can give us

You open up the sensors to try to find the mechs cockpit. The returns are
wierd, half the sensors show normal readings, and the other half can't detect
the mech at all. But the layout seems relatively normal.

It's only now that you realise this thing is significantly taller than your R-
Blade, 30 meters to your 20, and its blades are a touch longer than your
tonfas. Its counterattack almost skewers you before the blades make contact,
and you sluggishly avoid them, stumbling as you land. It waits as you regain
your footing, stopped in mid-pose, as if unwilling to move if it doesn't have
to.

Behind you, you vaguely hear someone speak over a loudhailer in japanese, but
you would have issues understanding him even if sober. You open up with vulcans
on the black mech, finally getting to move, boosting away towards what looks
like a residential district.

WHAT WILL OUR HEROINE DO? The military is close, but they'll never be able to
keep up with a proper mech like this.

Agreed.

We should use our Flight capabilities to our advantage and do quick pas by
attacks using the Tonfa's, comboed with the Vulcans. We should aim at joints
and at the cockpit, assuming we can figure out where that is.

Hmm... that changes things.

Still, we need to focus on using our flight capabilities to our advantage. It
will help avoid any extra damage to the area, which IS important.

I'm gonna say focus on getting behind it and to aim at it's joints.

but has the Tesla Drive that the R-Eins has alongside the Blade Tonfa of the R-

Taking to the air, you flit around the black mech, stabbing and feinting,
looking for a weak point in its defenses. Its longer arms and weapons make this
difficult, however, and you only score some scratches. It raises the blades and
launches some kind of discs of light from them, forcing you away.

You tune your radio to the G-Force frequency. "Guysh, guysh, I need backup
'ere!"

Diego Mireniamu's voice drones over the static-filled connection. "We're
deploying what forces we can. The TDF are moving in, I'm trying to clarify
which giant metal man they shouldn't shoot."

"Cool...Where's Akane? She said she knew what dis ting was."

"I'll have someone find her, the situations a little chaotic right now. Hang
tight, and try to lead it towards the harbour! It's half-wrecked anyway!"

Windows and door across the suburbs blow in as the large mech takes off, firing
on the biplanes which have begun strafing it. One is clipped and tumbles out of
the air in flames, its pilot miraculously diving out and managing to pull his
parachute in time.

ATTACK IT WHILE ITS DISTRACTED, TRY TO DRAW IT OFF, OR SOMETHING ELSE?

"'Ey, ugly!!" You flit around the ring fire, vulcans flaring wildly. You hit
very little, almost catching some of the TDF planes. "I'm yer dance partner
here! You wanna scan me, you gotta catch me." You reverse the throttle and back
away, still dodging the energy rings. The Arm Arcus gains hieght and tries
firing down on you, buildings popping like firecrackers beneath you. You swear
to yourself.

"Yo, Fuego-san, can't you get some artillery up here? I'm a little short on
firepower."

"The TDF can't fire unless they're sure of a target, the collateral damage
could be tremendous! Lead it to the harbor, I'll try to get the Aderu to
support you from the bay.

The municipal buildings and fancy buildings give way to water-logged warehouses
and ruined tenements, as you seek cover from the black mechs constant fire.
Whatever else its attributes, its not too worried about ammo conservation.

WHAT IS OUR NEXT STEP IN THE PLAN? You have a plan, right?

A plan? Other than getting it to the harbor, I'm not sure Katina is rational
enough to come up with something that can work.

For now I say we should focus on leading it to the Harbor... And possibly
leading it towards the Space/Time Fissure. We should ask the docs whether we
can use that to our advantage.

Okay.

Now that I've finished asking questions with obvious answers, I have our plan -
We knock it into the fissure, using the R-Blade to harry it and whatever high-
yield cannons the ground crew possess to knock it back. Finally, we RIDER KICK
it into the Fissure.

It might come back later, but it'll at least buy us some time to get decent
weaponry.

As you head out over the water, you see on your scope that the Arm Arcus is
falling behind. You look back and see weapons unfolding from its hips and
shoulders. The emotionless voice comes over the comm again.

"Your unit is not equipped for long-range engagements. Your ability to
compensate for this design oversight will be tested."

The storm of beams erupts around you as you desperately dodge. Perhaps if you'd
been sober, you'd have evaded the first volley. But sluggish as you are, one of
the laser rings severs your left arm, and a plasma beam strike you in the mid-
section. Power is lost for a few vital seconds, and the R-Blade hits the water
hard.

"Insufficient."

"Fuck...you..." You try to right the R-Blade and stop it sinking, grabbing your
arm before it sinks to the bottom. Without the underwater OS kicking in, you
probably wouldn't have been able to.

"Your Significance has been overestimated. Explain your ability to interface
with the Next Level, and you will be permitted to function normally."

You bring yourself level, and try to scan for the Arm Arcus, but theres too
much interference, from both the water and the Crack glowing wierdly a half a
mile behind you. Sticking your head above water probably wouldn't be the
smartest plan.

A new comm frequency opens up, apparently from G-Forces naval arm, the Science
Warship Aderu?

TALK TO THE ARM ARCUS, G-FORCE HQ, OR THE ADERU? And what will you say?

Assuming we are capable of contacting people one after another:

Tell the Aderu to blast the fucker with the biggest gun they have and try to
push it into the Fault.

THEN switch comms back to the DigiMech. Respond to it's inquiry: "What the fuck
are you expecting, I'm completely Wasted!" In an attempt to distract it from
the Aderu hopefully firing it's laser.

acknowledging the Aderu comes first.

On a side note, every time I see "Arcus," I think "Arceus." This is a dangerous

One other thing I should point out to those that want us to just attack the

You flip the new frequency up on the comm system, noting with some curiousity
that its a laser channel, and not simple radio like the others. "Yo, is that
the Adelaide? I need guns here!"

A mans voice "This is Captain Wadashu of the Aderu, we're getting out of dock
now. Our laser scanners have you and that black thing pinpointed."

"Yeah yeah. What kind of shit ya got on that thing?"

"Uh...the Aderu has quite a bit of 'shit'. Shes a Science Warship, she's been
modified by practically every Intellect thats ever set foot on her."

"I mean guns, dumbass."

"Right, right. We're built for speed over offense, but we've got the 100mm
Gatling, and the 400m Triple Rotary Mortar. The new laser scanners can
supposedly be set to offensive levels, but we've never tested them. And of

Mounted on the front is a massive drill, already churning up the waves at it

SHIT.

Ok, we need to distract it, and keep it at sea level. Full defense, focus on
staying alive.

Open a comm to it and tell it we're drunk, of course we are not up to snuff. We
might be able to get it to underestimate us if we do that.

While we are keeping it distracted, have the ship do a sneak attack giga dri-,
I mean Tokugawa Special to the fuckers back.

Wait a second...

We're getting the absolute crap kicked out of us by an unknown opponent. We are
putting our all into a gambit that will either work, or end up with us being
out of options. And we are near a strange phenomenon that things have a habit
of coming out of randomly.

Does anyone else see the parallel here that I do?

"Aquatic vessel detected. Interference unwelcome. Removing."

"FFFFFFF-"

The Arm Arcus turns to the oncoming warship as it opens up with its full
armament. Heavy gatling shells, crack against its armor and a blue laser cuts a
streak into it, but it boosts away from the mortar shells and redeploys its
extra weapons. All six guns crackles with orange lightning.

The helmsman screams. "It's going to blast us!! We've gotta evade."

"Don't bother, we won't make it. Convert us to Deep-sea Recovery mode, now!!"

The beam of orange death strikes out as the top and bottom of the Aderu open
up, creating a hole through its centre where the beam had been aiming. The
cruiser is tossed skyward by the water underneath it vaporising, but is still
intact.

"YOU'RE. FIGHTING! MEEEEE!!!!!!" You yell as you burst out of the water,
swinging your severed arm, still clutching the tonfa, as a crude axe. Unable to
dodge right after firing, the Arm Arcus is cut deeply in the side, its
thrusters flickering for a moment.

"I-have-had-enough-of-you KIIIICCCKKK!!!"

Your feet take the thing in the back, and you pull full thrust as the two of
you head towards the falling battleship. You break away just as the Arm Arcus
smashes into the spinning drill, and its midsection disintegrates, the legs
crushed underneath the ship as it hit the water again. The wave smacks right
into throwing you back with massive force. Your vision turns grey, and you
black out...

Katina sleeps.

Katina dreams....
"So you agree to become my slave, male?"

Absolutely! No questions asked!! I mean, how could a guy say no to a pretty
face like yours?

"Hmmph....its seems the males on this Patchwork have little spine. If it
weren't for the Queen, I doubt we'd even bother staying."

Hey, come on, this new world is great. Theres...Ugh...Well, ok, I've only been
here a few days, but theres a place at the other end of the city that sells
great frozen yoghurt. You want me to get you some, Mistress?[/i]

"...My sisters have been overzealous as usual. The other side of the city is on
fire."

All of it?

"It appears the males of this world have bad eyesight as well...."

I...I'm sure I can be some help to you. Go ahead, I'll do anything, really...

"...Carry this 'Argo Gulskii' onto my Scabbard, and then pilot it after my
Theotokos. I think I'll be leaving the main Shura force for a while...."

Th-this guy? He's huge, he probably weighs more than his mech did!

"The slaves of a Shura do not countermand their mistresses."

....Aw man, this is gonna be like Kiva all over again, I just know it...

The Ayers Rock hotel was one of the most prestigious pieces of tourist
accomodation on the planet. Normally it was booked 6 months in advance, but
apparently Yukiko Date had had little trouble getting rooms for thier meeting.

Yukiko adjusts her glasses and sits across the table from Mauser. "So, Colonel,
it seems things have developed somewhat since we last talked."

"We barely made it to your base here, thanks to those treacherous
Balmarians..."

"They are aliens, Colonel. They cannot truly consider humanity an ally, it is
the duty of any species to put itself first. That applies to us as much as to
them."

"They said they needed us, that they were desperate. I thought I could use that
as leverage."

"Their desperation will only lead them to be even more hostile. They will need
to pacify Earth in order to colonise it, hence why they've allied with the
faction who've already started the pacificiation..."

Vindels eyes go wide. "The First and Only? Dammit, how are we to deal with
their combined forces?"

"Solidarity between the aliens can only be countered in one way: Solidarity
between humans. We're going to have to...improve the terms of our alliance."

"What do you mean? Are you saying you want to absorb the Shadow Mirrors fully?
I won't allow that!!"

"Please, Colonel, this is not a situation that requires an Idealistic approach.
We'll both have to compromise. In the end, all I truly want is an Earth purged
of alien influence. Whether that Earth is united or plunged into eternal war is
irrelevant to me, so long as its an Earth of humanity..."

Maybe, but he does not appear to be in this specific scene.

We seem to be seeing things from Jamie's point of view due to our connection to
him, with both of us being Anti-Psychodrivers.

I am thinking that the the IoS ended up near a city, and it came under attack
while they were there. Jamie, but I doubt Coop would just surrender, espcially
after these chicks destroyed an awesome Yogurt shop.

ANOTHER ELSEWHERE, BUT MUCH CLOSER

Agent Hayato Jin walks past the busy crisis room, unconcerned by the drama of
the Black Metal Man. It has been stopped before it reached Edo Intelligence,
that was all that mattered. Jin had a more important job: Stopping a war.

He unlocks the cell door and toss the handcuff keys to the dark-skinned man
inside. "Ok, Miki-Shoi, your bosses and my bosses have finally managed to get
messages to each other. You've been upgraded from Unknown Gaijin to Military
Guest. I'd have brought you a party hat for the celebration, but we're fresh
out."

The young man fumbles at his handcuffs. "Stop calling me 'Mee-Kee-Showy', it
sounds wrong. It's Mickey, Ensign Mickey Smith. You've asked me for it enough
times."

"Look kid, I have way too little time to care about your fucked-up accent."

"It's just British! It's not that wierd!"

"There's no such place as Britishland on Toholon, kid, and I doubt theres one
in this world either. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll hand you off to someone
more diplomatic. Then I'm gonna go drink a lot of coffee, and re-read
everything you've said about this 'Corusa Industries'. It seem we're going to
be getting even more guests soon..."

I never actually confirmed his identity as being based on the DW character, I
only said he was british, and someone else suggested who he might be. It made

You come to to the sight of Akanes face, before being struck blind once more by
the blinding pain in your head. "Aw shiiiitt, I've gotta stop having hangovers
and concussions on the same days..."

Akane looks relieved as you manuver out of the bed. "It seems you managed to
survive both the Databases and your own attempts to kill you. And with only a
day in bed too."

"Being more dangerous to me than anyone else is one of my goals in life. Is my
dress here? Shit, I'm going to need to get more...How is the R-Blade?"

"Your mech is being fixed, Professor Saotome wants to talk to you about it. Mr
Mireniamu also said he'd like to talk to you once he has time, about finding
your friends. And Mr Maki also said he had news of sorts." She looks slightly
glum at this. "Not about anyone called Ardygun, though..."

WHO WILL KATINA GO TALK TO? OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE SHE WANTS TO DO FIRST?

It's Couchs thing, the Orbit Exceeder Kerykeion setting. He was kind enough to
give me a whole bunch of setting and plot details, and free reign to
reinterpret them to fit my purposes. I felt it wouldn't hurt to throw in a few
details.

(The Zeorymer stuff seems to be old, from when his idea was a bit more
fanficcy. I'm using the standalone version he made for a thread on /m/, he
linked it during the planning threads I think.)

Still, it would provide an interesting way to include the Hades Project, don't
you agree? And having Zeorymer would allow them to survive some of the nasty
things running around in here...

Thus they'd probably only bring it out for...special occasions. Chances are

None of them are really known for subtlety anyway. I mean, Lanstar is the
weakest and its primary method of attack is creating tornadoes strong enough to
expose bedrock.

Hell, Burrstone has strategic nuclear warheads and it's strictly middle-class.
None of them are really all that weak to begin with.

Hades Project Zeorymer, one of the standards for overpowered robots before
things like Gurren Lagann came along. Lots of gigantic explosions and JUST AS
PLANNED.

The OVA is somewhat below-average though, but it's been featured in both SRW MX
and J, where the title robot was a broken powerhouse.

Hades Project Zeorymer, a late 80s/early 90s OVA based on a H-Manga, based
around 8 horribly powerful super robots. 7 were being controlled by Vaguely
Chinese Supervillain Crime Syndicate to Take Over the World (Of COURSE!!!), but
the 8th and most powerful, Zeorymer of the Heavens, was given to an angsty teen
by a morally ambigous government group. It's Evangelion versus Big Fire, but
not as awesome as it should be.

I agree with hugging Akane. In a completely non-molesty sort of way.

Akane is slightly taken aback by the hug. "It'll be ok, Akane, we'll find them.
We'll find everyone. I believe in all of them, they'll live..."

"...Thank you Katina, it means a lot to hear that fr-"

"And if any of those assholes die, I'll go down to hell and pop them right in
the face for being so stupid!!"

"...."

"Ok, I'll go see the Profesors now."

You dress yourself quickly (You've gotten increasingly adept at putting on your
elaborate dresses incredibly quickly), and head downstairs. As you go, you turn
to Akane. "Hey, Akane, ever heard of something called the Shura?"

"Can't say I have, and I've seen a lot of things with wierd names."

"Right, we'll get back to those later..." You pause as you see something very
odd: Two identical women, about 3 feet tall yet proportioned as adults, walking
down the next corridor hand in hand while singing a low melody.

INVESTIGATE THIS, OR CONTINUE TO DR. SAOTOME?

"...Come along, Akane. We have things to be doing."

"You get used to it after a while, don't you? Sort of sad, in a way."

"Maybe..."

You reenter the garage and find the R-Blade once again being cleaned of the
contaminating seawater. A large set of equipment is covering the point where
the arm was severed, but otherwise everything seems to be in place.

Professor Saotome turns to face you. "Ah, Katina. How's your head today?"

"Don't start. Whats your prognosis?"

"It'll take a bit more maintenance, and we'll have to machine some parts, but
we should get in running by tomorrow. Mori-Mori's handling the welding, said
something about using vacuum to avoid oxidation. Oh, and I have something for
you."

He throws you a ragged red scarf, which you catch in midair. The wieght of it
feels off, as if theres metal in it. You grab one end and swing it about, and
it wraps around a nearby toolbox and draws tight, crushing the box and mangling
the tools inside.

"I'd suggest you get used to it before you start wearing it, don't want to
choke yourself on it. Now, I can make an upscaled version of that for your
mech."

"Can't see why I wouldn't want such a thing."

"OR, I can make something slightly different. When we were testing your
magneto-gravitic flight device, I noticed it operated on one of the 3
fundamental frequencies that G-Eta particles can operate in. I could make a
similar covering that'd work with the Tesla Drive, to give you more speed and
control. But the two would interfere with each other if we tried both at once."

SHOULD THE R-BLADE GET A DEADLY RYOMA SCARF OR A GETTER WING?

AND WHAT WILL WE DO NEXT?

I say lets go with the G-Eta Wing for now. While I DO like the scarf Idea, a
Scarf sword would be easier to replicatie with other types of tech than the S-
Rank Flight would.

If we go with the scarf, we should also bring up the revolvers.

You are not understanding what it does.

The Wing increases the speed and utility of the R-Wing in the Air. It
essentially increases our defensive capabilities, something we are in great
need of espcially considering our last battle.

Also, I'm neutral - on the one hand, we could get some more use out of the
scarf-sword, on the other hand, we already have Blade Tonfa for melee. It might
be better to get the Wing and get our guns repaired.

"You're sure you can't do both?" You flick the scarf again, and the toolbox is
sliced in half. "'Cause fun as this is, it wouldn't beat out a proper gun."

"I tried, worked at it most of yesterday while you were out of it. The material
won't hold two different sets of particles. It can take 1, or 3, but the three-
mode one would be basically uncontrollable, it'd just end up wrapping itself
around the mech and crushing it."

"Ok, fine, I'll take the cutty-crushy-scarf then. Now, where can a girl get
some proper-sized guns around here?"

"Hmm...Military surplus is tightly controlled in Tokugawa, with so much left
around after the civil war the goverment make sure to keep tabs on it. We're
exempt from most of the restrictions, but we have to go through specific
channels, and that takes time."

"What about making our own weapons?"

"We're set up for that...But we don't have a proper gunsmith. Dr. Nakamura was
meant to be our specialist in that regard, but he dissappeared. Mireniamu tried
looking for a replacement, but most of the other weapon specialists had been
snapped up by the army. Seems they're restarting the Superweapons Development
Programs."

"And theres no chance we'd get access to those?"

"Not so long as the military top brass say no. The High Intellect might believe
in all government departments getting along and working for the betterment of
all, but in practise, anything the military really cares about is done off the
books, and they can deny they have anything."

"Fuck...Well, what about my G-Revolvers?"

"Magnetism isn't my thing, but I can ask some colleagues maybe."

You enter Mr Mireniamu's office as he tosses the last of a large pile of
paperwork into what you assume is his OUT box. "Ah, Ms. Tarask, your timing is
perfect. I'd like to discuss matters with you and Ms Ardygun, if I may."

"Yeah, you said something about finding our friends?"

"Well, that would be one of the objectives in mind...Has Ms Akane told you what
she told me, about this 'Database' organisation?"

"Uh, no, I guess I forgot to ask her."

Akane sits down and folds her hands together. "The mech you fought is very
similar to a type we fought in our world. It belongs to the Database, a
collection of beings dedicated to the collection of all the data in the
universe."

"Killer librarians? Don't seem too scary, even if they've got good mechs."

"No, its not as simple as that. After billions of years of simply recording
data, they decided to become the final word on the universe. As soon as they
collected data on a civilisation, they would destroy, so only they would have
the memory of it. They ultimately intended for the universe to be their own,
locked up in their filing system."

"Oh. Thats a little different."

"The heroes of Earth united to stop them, but the conflict escalated, until
finally a weapon was made that decided the whole thing. The Dark Eva Nova
shattered our world, our universe, and left us here..."

Mireniamu nods. "You can see, Ms Tarask, why we'd like to avoid a conflict with
these people."

"Well, if they could just blow up the universe, why didn't they do it last
night?"

Akane raises a finger. "Two nights ago, actually."

"My point is, they're probably no better off than the rest of us are, a couple
of mechs hidden in a cave somewhere. We don't need to shit our pants over
this."

"Katina...their technology is incredible. They have generate new mechs
basically from thin air, by copying the memory they have of mechs and pilots.
If they get power to reactivate their technology, they can create an whole army
and take over this world in no time. We need to find them and convince them, or
stop them, before that happens."

".....FFFFFFuck!!! Why can I have enemies that don't cheat?!?!"

Mireniamu coughs politely. "More to the point, Ms Tarask...Tokugawa, even if we
link up with all the other Crescent Islands, isn't in the right condition to
fight a protracted war with that kind of foe. Maybe, given a few months to
prepare ourselves, we can make new weapons to fight such things, but as it
stands, we must avoid more encounters with them before they're ready. That
means, any reason they would have to come to Edo would have to be shunted
aside."

"You mean...Like me and Akane."

"Exactly. Luckily, you have an excuse to leave anyway, and we have a job for
you."

also spare a few of the active roster, and I'll see if theres much else I can
scrounge up for you."

"And where would we be going?"

"Pick a direction. Except east, apparently we've already made contact with
something called 'Canada' in that direction, and the diplomatic corps don't
want anyone stealing their thunder. However, we have some other reports from
long-range patrols. They show three interesting locations we might consider."

"Ok, shoot, whadya got?"

"There's one to the south, which made intermittent radio contact with the
scout. It's apparently called 'Japan', and theres a large city on the northern
shore, a large port. Looks really new in the photos."

"Keep going..."

"To the west is some kind of artificial island, dominated by a large statue of
some kind. We couldn't make contact as the radio frequencies were filled with
music. And in the northwest, a scout was attacked by some kind of metal
monster, and reported sighting several different kinds as it retreated. Some
seemed to be fighting each other."

RESPONSE FROM KATINA? QUESTIONS, REQUESTS, OR ACCEPTANCE? You can ask anything
at this point.

I kinda think west is Macross land. The artificial could be a landed colony
ship, and the giant statue could even be the SDF macross itself. And you
couldn't talk to them because of music l:/.

I may have only actively watched Macross 7, but it seems to fit the bill enough
for a mashed up abortion of the macross franchise that this world would spawn.

Y to everyone except Ogomo and maybe Kajio.
Uh...custom paintjob for either the R-Blade or the Warship. We need to look
good.

Also ask if it's possible to sculpt pretty frills out of armor materials.

Literally anything you think this city can provide for you. Let your
imagination go wild. It can be a thing or a person, or a small number of both.
It doesn't nessecarily have to have been mentioned before.

Examples off the top of my head:
Anti-Kaiju Sleeping Gas Missiles
An Expert Anthropologist who speaks dozens of languages and knows all types of
cultures.
The Battra Cocoon and the Shobijin to control it (hopefully).

These are just a few ideas that occur to me.

Also, I think we should not take too much of team two with us, they still need
them around here. Same with the Non-Zondark Scientists, they need them for
weapons, while we can use Zondark to try and find our friends.

As much as I'd love to develop a Photonic Cannon or reinforce the R Blade with
Chogokin ZEEEEEET, dimensional scopes are necessary to find our friends.
Probably. At the very least, they would help us find Dumi or the Compatible
Kaiser.

CHOOSE Y/N TO EACH OF THE FOLLOWING:
Kaijo Maki: N, he can't be expected to know much outside of Edo.
Chouko Hotaro: Sure, why not?
Lord Ogomo: Is there any guarantee his money will be accepted outside of the
island? If not, N.
Nozumi Itoshi: Sure, why not?
Yume: Sure, why not?

And as for a super special awesome request? If this getter scarf is anything
like it was in the show, it's red. And that means we need to paint the R Blade
something to match it. So, I'm voting for R-Blade Katina Custom Colors. Black
and gold go good with red, as long as the black's the main color and gold is
just for minor stuff like vents and edge panels.

If not that, and we do head to Macross City? Use some Valkyrie technology to
make a Katina ART-1 Custom.

Heh. When they arrive at Zoidland and get jumped by a giant wind-up Mr. Ed,
you'll be sorry you scoffed at the unimech.

Jokes aside. Has anyone considered the potential utility of a harpoon or
javelin made of that morphic "scarf" material? Its ability to wrap around,
penetrate, or otherwise screw with internal machinery on a continuing basis
makes it potentially more damaging than a kinetic penetrator or explosive
round.

Oh, well in that case, for the Special request: On an island country that seems
to be constantly attacked by giant animal like monster, theres got to be some
kind of authority on strange creatures/an explorer or something we can borrow.
If we head into zoids land, having someone who knows about animal behavior and

The cloth itself is G-Eta strengthened industry-grade linen, tough but not
bullet-proof. The real strength of the scarf is a set of metal wires and
sharpened strips running through it, that morph according to the hand motions
you make. Thus it can be used to wrap around melee weapons or gun barrels, but
bullets or beams would pass right through it.
