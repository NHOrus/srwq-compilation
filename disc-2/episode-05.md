Last time on Disc 2, we actually managed to get some plot done, as our heroine Katina Tarask found another survivor from a slightly more compatible world, and managed to get a cryptic message from her lost partner Dumi. However, while she was drinking away her sorrows, an unusual black mech appeared and began strolling through the city, as if searching for something. Our inebriated heroine immediately went to get her mech...

(Repost from end of last thread, because I totally forgot how near we were to autosage)

You run along the street, with Akane right behind you, chasing the mech and the mad elf. The Arcus easily outpaces you all, plodding through the streets of Edo, smashing windows and popping street lights, but little else. It occasionally sends light from its eyes into larger buildings, apparently scanning them for something. Sirens blare across the city, and what few people were on the streets make for cover. The city seems to have a good number of shelters and secure structures to take cover in.

The things walks on, up to G-Force HQ. Its scan-beams pass over it, and linger a while longer than the other buildings, but then it walks over, knocking over several walls as it goes. You reach the HQ a minute later, overtaking an out-of-breath Nozumi.

A large man wearing at least 3 belts of grenades leads the G-Force Security Team to secure the grounds. "Ready all explosives! If it comes back this way, fire everything! And if you die, curse those cheapskates in the army for not giving you bigger guns!"

You ignore the lightly armed guards and head over to the R-Blade, which is now standing in the yard. Saotome hops down from the cockpit. "I've gotten it warmed up for you. Sure you're fit to fly it?"

"'m too drunk to answers that kestion wi'out bias."

"...I'm sure you'll do fine."

The R-Blade boots up, and turns to face the black mech, which is headed to the city centre, and the few skyscrapers in this old-timey city. Your radar registers planes and tanks coming from the north.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

You flip open your comms and hiccup. "Ugh, yeah, you, black dude, dude in the black mech...S'rrend'r."

It doesn't respond. It seems to be walking past the main commercial district, and is now headed north, towards the military force.

"YO! FUCKWAD! YOU TALK TO ME OR IMMA STUFF THESE TONFINGS UP YER ASS!!"

"Dimensional significant, are you the source of signals #3829 and #3843?"

"Huh? Shaddap about my signals, you have to surrender!"

"Probability raised to 47%. Moving to analyse."

The black thing, like a picture of a mech painted over the world, turns back towards you. A sort of wireframe appears in its hands, then fills in with light, and the thing is now carrying two ornate blades.

"Submit to full scan or combat analysis will become nessecary."

"Nessecary? I'm Katina Tarask, its fuckin' mandatory!!!"

You take off and boost forward, tonfas drawn.

You open up the sensors to try to find the mechs cockpit. The returns are wierd, half the sensors show normal readings, and the other half can't detect the mech at all. But the layout seems relatively normal.

It's only now that you realise this thing is significantly taller than your R-Blade, 30 meters to your 20, and its blades are a touch longer than your tonfas. Its counterattack almost skewers you before the blades make contact, and you sluggishly avoid them, stumbling as you land. It waits as you regain your footing, stopped in mid-pose, as if unwilling to move if it doesn't have to.

Behind you, you vaguely hear someone speak over a loudhailer in japanese, but you would have issues understanding him even if sober. You open up with vulcans on the black mech, finally getting to move, boosting away towards what looks like a residential district.

WHAT WILL OUR HEROINE DO? The military is close, but they'll never be able to keep up with a proper mech like this.

Taking to the air, you flit around the black mech, stabbing and feinting, looking for a weak point in its defenses. Its longer arms and weapons make this difficult, however, and you only score some scratches. It raises the blades and launches some kind of discs of light from them, forcing you away.

You tune your radio to the G-Force frequency. "Guysh, guysh, I need backup 'ere!"

Diego Mireniamu's voice drones over the static-filled connection. "We're deploying what forces we can. The TDF are moving in, I'm trying to clarify which giant metal man they shouldn't shoot."

"Cool...Where's Akane? She said she knew what dis ting was."

"I'll have someone find her, the situations a little chaotic right now. Hang tight, and try to lead it towards the harbour! It's half-wrecked anyway!"

Windows and door across the suburbs blow in as the large mech takes off, firing on the biplanes which have begun strafing it. One is clipped and tumbles out of the air in flames, its pilot miraculously diving out and managing to pull his parachute in time.

You reverse the throttle and back away, still dodging the energy rings. The Arm Arcus gains hieght and tries firing down on you, buildings popping like firecrackers beneath you. You swear to yourself.

"Yo, Fuego-san, can't you get some artillery up here? I'm a little short on firepower."

"The TDF can't fire unless they're sure of a target, the collateral damage could be tremendous! Lead it to the harbor, I'll try to get the Aderu to support you from the bay.

The municipal buildings and fancy buildings give way to water-logged warehouses and ruined tenements, as you seek cover from the black mechs constant fire. Whatever else its attributes, its not too worried about ammo conservation.

Okay.

Now that I've finished asking questions with obvious answers, I have our plan - We knock it into the fissure, using the R-Blade to harry it and whatever high-yield cannons the ground crew possess to knock it back. Finally, we RIDER KICK it into the Fissure.

It might come back later, but it'll at least buy us some time to get decent weaponry.

As you head out over the water, you see on your scope that the Arm Arcus is falling behind. You look back and see weapons unfolding from its hips and shoulders. The emotionless voice comes over the comm again.

"Your unit is not equipped for long-range engagements. Your ability to compensate for this design oversight will be tested."

The storm of beams erupts around you as you desperately dodge. Perhaps if you'd been sober, you'd have evaded the first volley. But sluggish as you are, one of the laser rings severs your left arm, and a plasma beam strike you in the mid-section. Power is lost for a few vital seconds, and the R-Blade hits the water hard.

"Insufficient."

"Fuck...you..." You try to right the R-Blade and stop it sinking, grabbing your arm before it sinks to the bottom. Without the underwater OS kicking in, you probably wouldn't have been able to.

"Your Significance has been overestimated. Explain your ability to interface with the Next Level, and you will be permitted to function normally."

You bring yourself level, and try to scan for the Arm Arcus, but theres too much interference, from both the water and the Crack glowing wierdly a half a mile behind you. Sticking your head above water probably wouldn't be the smartest plan.

A new comm frequency opens up, apparently from G-Forces naval arm, the Science Warship Aderu?

TALK TO THE ARM ARCUS, G-FORCE HQ, OR THE ADERU? And what will you say?

A mans voice "This is Captain Wadashu of the Aderu, we're getting out of dock now. Our laser scanners have you and that black thing pinpointed."

"Yeah yeah. What kind of shit ya got on that thing?"

"Uh...the Aderu has quite a bit of 'shit'. Shes a Science Warship, she's been modified by practically every Intellect thats ever set foot on her."

"Right, right. We're built for speed over offense, but we've got the 100mm Gatling, and the 400m Triple Rotary Mortar. The new laser scanners can supposedly be set to offensive levels, but we've never tested them. And of course, we've got the Tokugawa Special..."

"Aquatic vessel detected. Interference unwelcome. Removing."

"FFFFFFF-"

The Arm Arcus turns to the oncoming warship as it opens up with its full armament. Heavy gatling shells, crack against its armor and a blue laser cuts a streak into it, but it boosts away from the mortar shells and redeploys its extra weapons. All six guns crackles with orange lightning.

The helmsman screams. "It's going to blast us!! We've gotta evade."

"Don't bother, we won't make it. Convert us to Deep-sea Recovery mode, now!!"

The beam of orange death strikes out as the top and bottom of the Aderu open up, creating a hole through its centre where the beam had been aiming. The cruiser is tossed skyward by the water underneath it vaporising, but is still intact.

"YOU'RE. FIGHTING! MEEEEE!!!!!!" You yell as you burst out of the water, swinging your severed arm, still clutching the tonfa, as a crude axe. Unable to dodge right after firing, the Arm Arcus is cut deeply in the side, its thrusters flickering for a moment.

"I-have-had-enough-of-you KIIIICCCKKK!!!"

Your feet take the thing in the back, and you pull full thrust as the two of you head towards the falling battleship. You break away just as the Arm Arcus smashes into the spinning drill, and its midsection disintegrates, the legs crushed underneath the ship as it hit the water again. The wave smacks right into throwing you back with massive force. Your vision turns grey, and you black out...

She appreciates the fine details as well as the broad.

Yukiko adjusts her glasses and sits across the table from Mauser. "So, Colonel, it seems things have developed somewhat since we last talked."

"We barely made it to your base here, thanks to those treacherous Balmarians..."

"They are aliens, Colonel. They cannot truly consider humanity an ally, it is the duty of any species to put itself first. That applies to us as much as to them."

"They said they needed us, that they were desperate. I thought I could use that as leverage."

"Their desperation will only lead them to be even more hostile. They will need to pacify Earth in order to colonise it, hence why they've allied with the faction who've already started the pacificiation..."

Vindels eyes go wide. "The First and Only? Dammit, how are we to deal with their combined forces?"

"Solidarity between the aliens can only be countered in one way: Solidarity between humans. We're going to have to...improve the terms of our alliance."

"What do you mean? Are you saying you want to absorb the Shadow Mirrors fully? I won't allow that!!"

"Please, Colonel, this is not a situation that requires an Idealistic approach. We'll both have to compromise. In the end, all I truly want is an Earth purged of alien influence. Whether that Earth is united or plunged into eternal war is irrelevant to me, so long as its an Earth of humanity..."

You come to to the sight of Akanes face, before being struck blind once more by the blinding pain in your head. "Aw shiiiitt, I've gotta stop having hangovers and concussions on the same days..."

Akane looks relieved as you manuver out of the bed. "It seems you managed to survive both the Databases and your own attempts to kill you. And with only a day in bed too."

"Being more dangerous to me than anyone else is one of my goals in life. Is my dress here? Shit, I'm going to need to get more...How is the R-Blade?"

"Your mech is being fixed, Professor Saotome wants to talk to you about it. Mr Mireniamu also said he'd like to talk to you once he has time, about finding your friends. And Mr Maki also said he had news of sorts." She looks slightly glum at this. "Not about anyone called Ardygun, though..."

Hades Project Zeorymer, a late 80s/early 90s OVA based on a H-Manga, based around 8 horribly powerful super robots. 7 were being controlled by Vaguely Chinese Supervillain Crime Syndicate to Take Over the World (Of COURSE!!!), but the 8th and most powerful, Zeorymer of the Heavens, was given to an angsty teen by a morally ambigous government group. It's Evangelion versus Big Fire, but not as awesome as it should be.

You reenter the garage and find the R-Blade once again being cleaned of the contaminating seawater. A large set of equipment is covering the point where the arm was severed, but otherwise everything seems to be in place.

Professor Saotome turns to face you. "Ah, Katina. How's your head today?"

"Don't start. Whats your prognosis?"

"It'll take a bit more maintenance, and we'll have to machine some parts, but we should get in running by tomorrow. Mori-Mori's handling the welding, said something about using vacuum to avoid oxidation. Oh, and I have something for you."

He throws you a ragged red scarf, which you catch in midair. The wieght of it feels off, as if theres metal in it. You grab one end and swing it about, and it wraps around a nearby toolbox and draws tight, crushing the box and mangling the tools inside.

"I'd suggest you get used to it before you start wearing it, don't want to choke yourself on it. Now, I can make an upscaled version of that for your mech."

"Can't see why I wouldn't want such a thing."

"OR, I can make something slightly different.

Also, I'm neutral - on the one hand, we could get some more use out of the scarf-sword, on the other hand, we already have Blade Tonfa for melee. It might be better to get the Wing and get our guns repaired.

"You're sure you can't do both?" You flick the scarf again, and the toolbox is sliced in half. "'Cause fun as this is, it wouldn't beat out a proper gun."

"I tried, worked at it most of yesterday while you were out of it. The material won't hold two different sets of particles. It can take 1, or 3, but the three-mode one would be basically uncontrollable, it'd just end up wrapping itself around the mech and crushing it."

"Ok, fine, I'll take the cutty-crushy-scarf then. Now, where can a girl get some proper-sized guns around here?"

"Hmm...Military surplus is tightly controlled in Tokugawa, with so much left around after the civil war the goverment make sure to keep tabs on it. We're exempt from most of the restrictions, but we have to go through specific channels, and that takes time."

"What about making our own weapons?"

"We're set up for that...But we don't have a proper gunsmith. Dr. Nakamura was meant to be our specialist in that regard, but he dissappeared. Mireniamu tried looking for a replacement, but most of the other weapon specialists had been snapped up by the army. Seems they're restarting the Superweapons Development Programs."

"And theres no chance we'd get access to those?"

"Not so long as the military top brass say no. The High Intellect might believe in all government departments getting along and working for the betterment of all, but in practise, anything the military really cares about is done off the books, and they can deny they have anything."

"Fuck...Well, what about my G-Revolvers?"

"Magnetism isn't my thing, but I can ask some colleagues maybe."

You enter Mr Mireniamu's office as he tosses the last of a large pile of paperwork into what you assume is his OUT box. "Ah, Ms. Tarask, your timing is perfect. I'd like to discuss matters with you and Ms Ardygun, if I may."

"Yeah, you said something about finding our friends?"

"Well, that would be one of the objectives in mind...Has Ms Akane told you what she told me, about this 'Database' organisation?"

"Uh, no, I guess I forgot to ask her."

Akane sits down and folds her hands together. "The mech you fought is very similar to a type we fought in our world. It belongs to the Database, a collection of beings dedicated to the collection of all the data in the universe."

"Killer librarians? Don't seem too scary, even if they've got good mechs."

"No, its not as simple as that. After billions of years of simply recording data, they decided to become the final word on the universe. As soon as they collected data on a civilisation, they would destroy, so only they would have the memory of it. They ultimately intended for the universe to be their own, locked up in their filing system."

"Oh. Thats a little different."

"The heroes of Earth united to stop them, but the conflict escalated, until finally a weapon was made that decided the whole thing. The Dark Eva Nova shattered our world, our universe, and left us here..."

Mireniamu nods. "You can see, Ms Tarask, why we'd like to avoid a conflict with these people."

"Well, if they could just blow up the universe, why didn't they do it last night?"

Akane raises a finger. "Two nights ago, actually."

"My point is, they're probably no better off than the rest of us are, a couple of mechs hidden in a cave somewhere. We don't need to shit our pants over this."

"Katina...their technology is incredible. They have generate new mechs basically from thin air, by copying the memory they have of mechs and pilots. If they get power to reactivate their technology, they can create an whole army and take over this world in no time. We need to find them and convince them, or stop them, before that happens."

".....FFFFFFuck!!! Why can I have enemies that don't cheat?!?!"

Mireniamu coughs politely. "More to the point, Ms Tarask...Tokugawa, even if we link up with all the other Crescent Islands, isn't in the right condition to fight a protracted war with that kind of foe. Maybe, given a few months to prepare ourselves, we can make new weapons to fight such things, but as it stands, we must avoid more encounters with them before they're ready. That means, any reason they would have to come to Edo would have to be shunted aside."

"Tokugawa needs to know what the makeup of this world is, and what that might entail for out future. You need to find your friends, and lose any pursuit the Database may be sending after you. These twin desires coincide beautifully."

You raise an eyebrow at Mr. Mireniamu. "You're sending up to make maps for you."

"No, we're sending cartographers to do that. You're being send to stir up the wasps nests, to interact with strange new civilisations, to meet interesting people and kill them."

"With what army?"

"Well, the army you'd build, would be my guess. But to start with, I'd be sending the Aderu with you, as soon as its repaired and we can gather enough crew to replace those injured in their little experiment in flying boats. I can also spare a few of the active roster, and I'll see if theres much else I can scrounge up for you."

"And where would we be going?"

"Pick a direction. Except east, apparently we've already made contact with something called 'Canada' in that direction, and the diplomatic corps don't want anyone stealing their thunder. However, we have some other reports from long-range patrols. They show three interesting locations we might consider."

"Ok, shoot, whadya got?"

"There's one to the south, which made intermittent radio contact with the scout. It's apparently called 'Japan', and theres a large city on the northern shore, a large port. Looks really new in the photos."

"Keep going..."

"To the west is some kind of artificial island, dominated by a large statue of some kind. We couldn't make contact as the radio frequencies were filled with music. And in the northwest, a scout was attacked by some kind of metal monster, and reported sighting several different kinds as it retreated. Some seemed to be fighting each other."

Thats not really something Mireniamu gives to us, its something we share with him.

Oh, I thought you meant something plot-related for down the road.

All right, changing the request for >>4763437: let's take along a few raw tons of the component metals/alloys for Chogokin C, just in case. Also a crate of Pocky/equivalent.

Well, any of those would be quite helpful. I'm guessing it would be possible to hook Battra's cocoon up to the warship and tow it along behind us.

The Battra Cocoon and the Shobijin to control it (hopefully).

This, This, THIS.

Also, I think we should not take too much of team two with us, they still need them around here. Same with the Non-Zondark Scientists, they need them for weapons, while we can use Zondark to try and find our friends.

As much as I'd love to develop a Photonic Cannon or reinforce the R Blade with Chogokin ZEEEEEET, dimensional scopes are necessary to find our friends. Probably. At the very least, they would help us find Dumi or the Compatible Kaiser.

CHOOSE Y/N TO EACH OF THE FOLLOWING:
Kaijo Maki: N, he can't be expected to know much outside of Edo.
Chouko Hotaro: Sure, why not?
Lord Ogomo: Is there any guarantee his money will be accepted outside of the island? If not, N.
Nozumi Itoshi: Sure, why not?
Yume: Sure, why not?

And as for a super special awesome request? If this getter scarf is anything like it was in the show, it's red. And that means we need to paint the R Blade something to match it. So, I'm voting for R-Blade Katina Custom Colors. Black and gold go good with red, as long as the black's the main color and gold is just for minor stuff like vents and edge panels.

If not that, and we do head to Macross City? Use some Valkyrie technology to make a Katina ART-1 Custom.

A man after my own heart...

And then Katina was an heir to the Bransteins or something of the sort.

Professor Choice:
Prof. Saotome and his Morphing Materials

We NEED to keep an eye on this "G-Eta" stuff. We cant have Saotome going all crazy on us like he does in most incarnations. He also seems really cool with building stuff for us " we want cool things" (2 days later) "Here's 2 working prototypes"

CHOOSE Y/N TO EACH OF THE FOLLOWING:
Kaijo Maki: (N) Leaving him here gives the best chances of Team 3 getting a fantastic array of female pilots....
Chouko Hotaro:(N) I dont remember much about this character, so yea.
Lord Ogomo: (N) Money does stuff here, money does NOT do stuff when fighting sentient machine animals. Keep him where he's useful
Nozumi Itoshi: (Y) I like pirates and pirate related characters
Yume: (Y) Shoes are for losers anyway

SPECIAL REQUEST: "Akane's Mech"
Ask for one of the 'Machines' that the army offered to give us when we got Akane. It seemed like they implied they had her mech (i don't even know what it is personally), more mechs = better.
Anonymous Sat 27 Mar 2010 04:18:39 No.4763500 Report
Heh. When they arrive at Zoidland and get jumped by a giant wind-up Mr. Ed, you'll be sorry you scoffed at the unimech.

Jokes aside. Has anyone considered the potential utility of a harpoon or javelin made of that morphic "scarf" material? Its ability to wrap around, penetrate, or otherwise screw with internal machinery on a continuing basis makes it potentially more damaging than a kinetic penetrator or explosive round.

Oh, well in that case, for the Special request: On an island country that seems to be constantly attacked by giant animal like monster, theres got to be some kind of authority on strange creatures/an explorer or something we can borrow. If we head into zoids land, having someone who knows about animal behavior and basic biology and stuff should be useful.

I should point out that Akane's "mech" was her escape pod... Not very useful in the long run.

Speaking as the one who -created- that company, he was presumably in one of these. It's not exactly weak, but it's a real-type about the size of our R-Blade, so kaijus would have given one trouble.

The cloth itself is G-Eta strengthened industry-grade linen, tough but not bullet-proof. The real strength of the scarf is a set of metal wires and sharpened strips running through it, that morph according to the hand motions you make. Thus it can be used to wrap around melee weapons or gun barrels, but bullets or beams would pass right through it.
