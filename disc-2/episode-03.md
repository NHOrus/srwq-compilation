##SRWQ2 Mission 3: If you'd included Fifth Element this would be so much simpler...

In our last thread, our heroine Katina Tarask got to know her new allies in anti-kaiju team G-Force, fixed up her wet R-Blade, and not much else because the thread got filled up with discussion of dangerous guns and Exalted characters.

"Right, our first course of action is to get more firepower for the team. And by 'the team', I mostly mean my R-Blade."

The rest of the G-Force team can't disagree with this sentiment. Kaijo, however, shakes his head. "Just asking for it from our suppliers hasn't gotten us anywhere quickly. We need to start appropriating things directly, going through normal channels won't cut it."

"Sounds like a plan I guess. What scientists do we have that we can tap?"

"Our science corps is the main one. Prof. Kabuto and his Photonic energy science have produced interesting results. He hasn't gotten his reactor working yet, but Yume was using special Photonic bullets on our last missions, and..." He spouts some japanese at the shoeless gunman, who places his hands about four feet apart. "He says the craters were about yay big."

"A start. And theres that Saotome dude and his tranforming metal."

Lord Ogomo grins and unbuckles his watch. He flicks his wrist and he's holding some wierd combination of an axe and a mace. "Yes, the good Professors work in that regard is quite interesting. Not that anyone would dare take my katana off me, but still, useful to own the prototype."

Kaijo nods "And we have Prof. Morimori's Chogokin Formula C, and Zondarks special detecting equipment. Then theres the stuff Nakamura and Meiun left behind, which we haven't really been able to reverse-engineer without them. And... well, we had contacts at the Space Development Corporation..."

"You guys had a space program?"

"Yes, but it was hit by a tidal wave during the Severing. Most of the people were lost, as well as the technology they were trying to stop the R Asteroid with. The place is a disaster zone right now, just like the southern part of the city."

You return to the garage where it seems the repairs on the R-Blade are complete. Saotome is in the cockpit, fiddling with controls to test the joints. You hear the rattle of the head vulcans cycling.

Morimori comes up to you. "Your humanoid vehicle is quite impressive. If I might ask, what exactly is it constructed from? I can't identify the alloy, is it something from your world?"

You shrug. "It should just be a Mao Industries Titanium alloy, nothing too special."

"Actually, I'd say it is. Titanium is hard to come by in the Crescent Isles, and hard to process in large amounts. Sendai Metals are one of the few companies which make anything large from it, and they control most of the supply. It's a shame, I was hoping to get some for Chogokin D..."

"Speaking of which, how hard would it be for you to add some of your metal to the R-Blade? Would it help any?"

"Not structurally, but it would be good for handling energy discharges or extreme heat. Plating something of that size, however... I'd need a factory to do."

"How about just affecting the weapons?"

"More doable, but those are some mighty big blades. I'd need to make a plating rig in the back of the garage... Give me a few days, I'll see what I can do."

You ponder Professor Morimoris idea. "Hmm... You said the metal was good for handling energy, right?"

"Yes, we had good results with the Photonic Magnum young Yume was testing. Any normal gun firing Photonically charged rounds would have exploded, but it performed admirably."

"What about electricity? Could you make it conduct lightning into whatever it stabbed?"

"Why, it might be possible... But you'd need a massive electricity discharge to have any noticable effect. A capacitor that large would be rather bulky, I'd imagine..."

"Hmm, ok, keep my posted on your ideas."

---

Professor Saotome seems rather intruiged by the various controls of the R-Blade. "Quite a complex apparatus... I assume you need a very precise computator to handle the motion issues?"

"Yeah, pretty much. Listen, I hear you're working on shape-changing metal?"

"Yes, it's my current major project. Why, looking for a sample? You look like a woman who'd appreciate some accessories that turn into deadly weapons."

"Well, yeah, but I'm thinking more for the R-Blade here. Some kind of scarf, or something, that can become... useful, when I need it to."

"That'd be a lot of material to work with. I'd need to upsize the Gate Transfuser to make something that size. And if you're away from a source of G-Eta particles, you'll only have one alternate form for the metal. Creating some sort of... G-Eta Reactor? I'm not sure I can do that currently... Or that I'd want to. I'm still learning the ropes on this procedure."

---

Professor Kabuto looks admirably at the contents of the 90mm vulcan shell he's cut open to inspect. "Interesting... Very interesting. If I were a chemist I'd be quite interested in the chemical explosive, but moostly I'm wondering if I can develop a Photonic version that still has a shaped explosion. Not that area-effect bursts would be that bad, would they? I'm not a soldier, not since I lost my eye in that sword-duel."

"Wait, so you're saying you're not really a weapons guy."

"No, its just that I've been having more luck drawing Photonic charge out of my generator and channeling it through specially prepared materials than with using it as a power source. Converting the photons into useful energy is the issue, the Photonic Reactor's output is just too high as it is. Every time I try to turn it to electricity, or use it to boil water, or anything else that can make things go, the extra equipment just ends up with a hole in it. I had to install a removable roof in my lab, and get permission from the city council for the light pollution."

"...Sounds to me like you've already got a weapon there."

"Hmmm... Using a reactor directly as an attack... Intruiging... But I don't have any spares just lying around. It'd take me a while to make new ones, maybe weeks."

You catch Zondark as the young man walked about the yard, waving another telescope-esque thing around in random directions. "Yo, Zoldark, got some questions."

"Er... It's Zondark. What did you wish to know?"

"I hear you made a Black Hole Gun. We had those in our world, they're awesome, when they work. I know someone who-"

"OHNONONONONO!! Quantum Singularities are dangerous things! We're still not sure what the exact effects of the first weapon were! Making another one is not a good plan. And besides, I only created the Gravitation Lenses and Dimensional Focuser, in order to better study gravi-dimensional phenomena... safely. It was Mr Nakamura who weaponised it."

"Damn and fuck! What is with this Nakumomo dude? Why was he coming up with all the cool shit?"

"Every Intellect is defined by their field of speciality. It's what seperates us from normal scientists and engineers. Mine is dimensional phenomena and their detection. My master Menezes is optics. The honorable professors inside are masters in material-energy interaction. Nakamura was... a gunsmith. He could take pretty much any set of physical objects or energy source, and find a way to make it hurt people. It was... a useful skill, given that he was part of the G-Force field team."

"And he just upped and fell into that big Crack, right when I needed him..."

Zondark looks crestfallen at the dissappointment on your face. "N-now, there are many other Intellects in Edo! I'm sure someone may be able to assist you... perhaps. If they have the time. And inclination. And aren't under arrest for megalomania or other conditions..."

"Fucking scientists..."  
"Wait, you said you know dimensional stuff, right? Does that mean you can figure out whats what in this new world?"

"I've been trying that very thing since the Severing. I've been trying to locate the source of the various dimensional phenomena involved for almost a week now, using devices like this Omniscope." Said Omniscope is currently focused on your bodice again. "But frankly, theres just too much to process right now! So many different phenomena to sort through, I've discovered something new every day, but I can't figure out how they all fit together. The intricacy involved it just too many aspects for one person to handle in a reasonable timeframe."

"So maybe you should just focus on one then."

"But there are two... Oh, you mean one aspect of the dimensional phenomenon. Yes, I suppose that would give me a starting point for the rest of them."

"God, this should be the most basic common sense..."

"Who?"
