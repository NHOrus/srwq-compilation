In our last thread, our heroine Katina Tarask got to know her new allies in
anti-kaiju team G-Force, fixed up her wet R-Blade, and not much else because
the thread got filled up with discussion of dangerous guns and Exalted
characters.

So, moving on.

(And no, the terrible MSpaint cut-and-paste art will never stop).

The fact that Katina has Ebony and Ivory AND Raising Heart makes me filled with

up.

"Right, our first course of action is to get more firepower for the team. And
by 'the team', I mostly mean my R-Blade."

The rest of the G-Force team can't disagree with this sentiment. Kaijo,
however, shakes his head. "Just asking for it from our suppliers hasn't gotten
us anywhere quickly. We need to start appropriating things directly, going
through normal channels won't cut it."

"Sounds like a plan I guess. What scientists do we have that we can tap?"

"Our science corps is the main one. Prof. Kabuto and his Photonic energy
science have produced interesting results. He hasn't gotten his reactor working
yet, but Yume was using special Photonic bullets on our last missions, and...."
He spouts some japanese at the shoeless gunman, who places his hands about four
feet apart. "He says the craters were about yay big."

"A start. And theres that Saotome dude and his tranforming metal."

Lord Ogomo grins and unbuckles his watch. He flicks his wrist and he's holding
some wierd combination of an axe and a mace. "Yes, the good Professors work in
that regard is quite interesting. Not that anyone would dare take my katana off
me, but still, useful to own the prototype."

Kaijo nods "And we have Prof. Morimori's Chogokin Formula C, and Zondarks
special detecting equipment. Then theres the stuff Nakamura and Meiun left
behind, which we haven't really been able to reverse-engineer without them.
And....well, we had contacts at the Space Development Corporation..."

"You guys had a space program?"

"Yes, but it was hit by a tidal wave during the Severing. Most of the people
were lost, as well as the technology they were trying to stop the R Asteroid
with. The place is a disaster zone right now, just like the southern part of
the city."

WILL YOU ASK FOR MORE IDEAS, TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE ABOUT POSSIBILITIES, OR FIND
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO?

No. We aren't quite ready for that yet.

We don't actually have any of those, its more a reference to everyone demanding
superscience weapons last thread, which I foresee this thread being mostly
about the procurement of.

I'm actually surprised more people didn't ask for Nanoha to get in, actually.

Nanoha would skyrocket the power threshold to levels we're still not quite
ready for yet. Even when we had a supercharged Raioh, I doubt we would have
been able to keep up with her.

Anyway, start asking what it would take to apply all this Super Science to the
R-Blade.

I have a list of possible things put together but most of them seem to be
unusable now that I have read just what we have, but first and foremost...

We need to see if Saotome can make the R-Blade a scarf out of that metal stuff.
If it can reform fluidly like that, it could be very useful.

WE should probably also take a look at the stuff the other team left behind,
just because it is super advanced here, does not mean it was in the SMverse.

Well, in true G-Eta fashion, they might wind up shooting rockets instead of

"Wild Goose" reminds me of the late-game missiles of the same name in Front
Mission 1st.

The reason I settled on "Dawn Kraken" generally lies in both Katina's old
School nickname and the fact that we're just starting out in this new world.

Also, as awesome as the R-Boiled will get, I wholly expect it to end as a
testbed for our previously discussed originals: the electro-tonfas are a
prototype for the Blades of Chaos per _>_>_4_7_4_9_7_9_1, the Dawn Kraken has elements
the Einsamkeit and Latooni's custom unit (forgot name) can appropriate, and so
forth.

You return to the garage where it seems the repairs on the R-Blade are
complete. Saotome is in the cockpit, fiddling with controls to test the joints.
You hear the rattle of the head vulcans cycling.

Morimori comes up to you. "Your humanoid vehicle is quite impressive. If I
might ask, what exactly is it constructed from? I can't identify the alloy, is
it something from your world?"

You shrug. "It should just be a Mao Industries Titanium alloy, nothing too
special."

"Actually, I'd say it is. Titanium is hard to come by in the Crescent Isles,
and hard to process in large amounts. Sendai Metals are one of the few
companies which make anything large from it, and they control most of the
supply. It's a shame, I was hoping to get some for Chogokin D..."

"Speaking of which, how hard would it be for you to add some of your metal to
the R-Blade? Would it help any?"

"Not structurally, but it would be good for handling energy discharges or
extreme heat. Plating something of that size, however...I'd need a factory to
do."

"How about just affecting the weapons?"

"More doable, but those are some mighty big blades. I'd need to make a plating
rig in the back of the garage...Give me a few days, I'll see what I can do."

That's how I decided on it, yes. No being, god or man, could bring harm to
Balder. It's reflective of both Latooni's superiority as a pilot and her
upbringing as something not to be harmed. The primary weapons are further named
for the legend - the rifle on its back, Viscumalbum, is derived from the word
for "mistletoe", and the Matricaria was the flower claimed to be modeled after
Balder's palate. Draupnir was Odin's golden ring that made nine duplicates of
itself every week - it was burned with Balder's body when he died as a tribute.

R-Blade vs Rodan... That would be fun. Aerial combat against Rodan would
probably one of those few battles where our Vulcan's could be useful. Pop one
or two holes in those wings and Rodan will drop, Pterosaurs had a horrible time
maintaining flight with damaged wings.

Rodan's wings have taken much more punishment then piddly 60mm vulcan fire and
remained intact, including Atomic Fire and Gravity Beam bursts. I doubt we
would even be able to get in range, since he's easily capable of breaking Mach
2 or 3 without much effort.

There is a difference between energy based attacks and physi- You know what?
Forget it, I'll give you that one.

As for the getting in Range part, that is part of why the fight would be
interesting. Depending on if this version of Rodan has ranged weapons or not
the fight might come down to us hovering in the air, and the Dodge/Countering
when Rodan tries to melee us.

Whilst I remember, I was thinking of running an /m/-original sidequest of sorts
for this... I dunno if I could write a bad enough end to avoid it clashing with
the main plot too badly though.

I'd only go ahead with it if you guys were alright with it and if Sciencegar
gave me canon approval though.

It'd be a story of one of the Shards finding out about the Desuverse's creation
(the hard way, exploration), and how they apply old hardware to new problems
(In their universe, for example, no kaiju. Just aliens trying to blow
everything up.)

That's the tl;dr version of the idea at least.

You will probably want to take a look at the universes and such that made it

I will say however it does sound interesting.

He has a list of series about 2/3's down that is called the "Final List".

Is it too late to make suggestions/alterations?

The presence of daikaiju and the R Blade's relative weakness has already been
noted. A new mecha design is in order, particulary one designed to take
advantage of the locals' radiant/kinetic energy technology.

The only people I see having a chance to catch a Infernal Exalted off guard is
the GITS crew, Tekkaman through his class abilities, and Satsujinki.

When it comes to wearing down his essence... You have to remember that most
Mecha pilots are NOT exalted, and are not going to last very long against
one... Other than people like Gai in GGGG and Ryoma in Shin Getter.

This one shouldn't be too hard to get past.

We have no way in hell of getting past this one... Unless Shinji or Vash have
an essence score.

Heh, this one is a pretty epic equalizer in this setting.

For reference, a 3 mote investment allows you to dash at full speed for no DV

has one of the more hax trees.

>I'm actually surprised more people didn't ask for Nanoha to get in, actually.

You mean we could have had Nanoha in? Have Signum meet Lamia? The White Devil
vs. Einsts and Dark Brain? Magical Girls vs. Humongous Mecha?

The next thing I know we could have tossed in Coop Aznable (aka Evil Coop from
Megas XLR series ) but that opportunity is missed as well.

The AT field is pretty Hax, but not as Hax as it would normally seem.

He has to take down his barrier to use his Psyker powers, and even with the
barrier up, you can get through it with strong enough attacks... Like say a D-
Ger Blade or a Heaven and Hell. Or anything that even resembles Getter Rays.
Remember Shin Getter raping Bardiel?

It is awesome.

Weapons loadout include: Two blades mounted on the arms ala Soulgain, each able
to detach and split into six for God of War-style rapeage.

Drill Fingertips

Twin Oxtongue Rifles mounted in leg armour, Algol is big enough to hold each
one-handed

Transforming Scarf

Grabby lightning, a keepy from RaiOh


Theres more info in the archives, mainly in the planning threads.

Nanoha is a magical girl franchise where the main is nicknamed the White Devil,
everybody else gets some sort of SRW/Gundam/etc. reference to their name, and
being blasted with magical laser cannons turns you into the main's friend (or
girlfriend, in Fate's case).

There's three series that grow increasingly /m/ with time: Magical Girl Lyrical
Nanoha, Nanoha A's (which sees Nanoha become part of an interdimensional
magical girl police force), and Nanoha Strikers (which sees her become a
ranking officer thereof).

combining Destroyah's horn/beam attacks, Barugon's destroying rainbow, and the
gross maneuverabilty and dash-ness of, say, a Hyaku Shiki with a tail.

The easiest way to deal with an OtT Shinji is of course to introduce an Asuka

Re: AT fields, there is no such thing as a perfect defense. However, when a
defense is an extension of self and will, there is more than the usual amount
of flexibility in HOW it may be applied.

We aren't even a master, so we don't give a fuck what is going to happen in the
grail war.

Don't forget that the grail only grants the winning pair their wishes and that
only if this grail is still pure and not a corrupted goozing mass of malice
like in the visual novel.

We aren't a master *yet*. For all we know we could end up becoming one later
on.

Also, this is undoubtedly the first Grail War on this world, so the grail
should be in a pure state as no one should have been able to cheat and summon
up an avenger.

Yes, but he wasn't a hero. Therefore he should have been ineligable. The reason
why non-heroes could be summoned afterwords was because of the taint. But how

It worked, but it turned out he was weak as hell and he got killed off very

I'm gonna make a few posts before bed.

On the point of Exalted and Perfect Defenses: If Creation and all its Essence
is gone, and the Exalt is part of the Grail War, he'll be using Mana, not
Essence, to fuel his charms. He won't be able to maintain his Essence and
Willpower levels with Stunting. He'll need other ways to gather Mana.

Exactly: Without the Pattern Spiders able to watch him and reward his stunts,
charm spam becomes a lot less viable, particularly Charms that use Willpower,
like the Perfect Defenses. He'll still kick loads of ass just with his un-
enhanced stats, but he won't be untouchable: He can be worn down.

Also, don't assume he'll be a full-on high-level demi-god: An experienced
Essence 3-4 Celestial Exalted is more than enough for most settings to crap
their pants in fright.

Son, I am disappoint.

I took note that not all plasma leader "selling points" were valid. I agree
with that slant. Also, you're apparently not familiar with certain German
terms. FLAK is more than shotgun equivalent.
Rainbow Scarf is an extra-long range beam weapon, a melee weapon, and a fashion
statement. Breast Crusher meets the physical weapon melee needs, I suspect.

> Also, possibly have the tail have a point-thing at the end then straighten

Tail is balance aid, fashion accessory for giant metal ass. Any number of
handheld weapons may be added as missions require, but those don't require
call-outs in preliminary design suggestions.

You ponder Professor Morimoris idea. "Hmm...You said the metal was good for
handling energy, right?"

"Yes, we had good results with the Photonic Magnum young Yume was testing. Any
normal gun firing Photonically charged rounds would have exploded, but it
performed admirably."

"What about electricity? Could you make it conduct lightning into whatever it
stabbed?"

"Why, it might be possible...But you'd need a massive electricity discharge to
have any noticable effect. A capacitor that large would be rather bulky, I'd
imagine..."

"Hmm, ok, keep my posted on your ideas."

Professor Saotome seems rather intruiged by the various controls of the R-
Blade. "Quite a complex apparatus...I assume you need a very precise computator
to handle the motion issues?"

"Yeah, pretty much. Listen, I hear you're working on shape-changing metal?"

"Yes, it's my current major project. Why, looking for a sample? You look like a
woman who'd appreciate some accessories that turn into deadly weapons."

"Well, yeah, but I'm thinking more for the R-Blade here. Some kind of scarf, or
something, that can become...useful, when I need it to."

"That'd be a lot of material to work with. I'd need to upsize the Gate
Transfuser to make something that size. And if you're away from a source of G-
Eta particles, you'll only have one alternate form for the metal. Creating some

One, I did approach the forum with what I thought was a proposal. I'm certainly
not the author here.
Two, the physics of semi-controlled remote blades were discussed in the threads
I was told to read.
I agreed with some of the comments. The BU retains energy/blade attacks with
the Destroyah-style horn, retains the shotgun equivalents in forearms, has a
scarf/extreme ranged weapon, makes fast melee attacks a main selling point, and
has an eye beam. (I decided to make it a single eye beam because of a certain
eyecolor schtick. Heh.)

If there's no interest I won't bother hunting up a scanner, but it seemed that
Boatlights Unicorn might meet a couple of humor points.

Well, at least we'd have a scarf version of Van's sword.

Thats good enough for me.

And if we can get the scarf back to Sophia, well...I think that idea speaks for
itself.

Also, we should probably get a man-sized scarf too, just for personal
protection.

Possible, and if you hook it up to the Fusion Reactor properly, not that hard
to charge. The problem is that the R-Blades wing assemblies could get in the
way. You'd have to reprogram the thruster system to avoid it burning off the
capacitor during tricky manuvers, and manuverability would be taking a hit.

Unless some intellect happens to have developed super-mini-capacitors, of
course.

like the scarf it gives us a useful tool for tripping up and entangling our

No. Do Not Want. Getter leads to fuckery, and not the kind that solves your
problems. Well, if you want to get technical, it -will- solve the problems you
had -before- you accidentally the Getter, but those problems will likely seem
kind of small in hindsight.

I've got no problem with the memory alloy scarf, though. Remember Wodan still
needs a Zankantou, so here's the opportunity to pick up the technology for him.

I was and to a degree still am in favor of moving away from lightning. As I
said before, we just stole the Raioh, it wasn't made for us. There's a very
strong movement to keep it, though, thus the compromise on making the Plasma
Tonfa function as electrified Blades of Chaos. I didn't and still don't agree
that they should somehow split into six, though. The mental image of actually
wielding that is hard to process, and it will likely lead to shenanigans,
indecision during combat, or both.

You have a point on the reactor, it might be a good idea to stay form that in

On the Algol:
I agree with you on the Blades, No way in hell should they be able to split
into six, two is all we need.

Professor Kabuto looks admirably at the contents of the 90mm vulcan shell he's
cut open to inspect. "Interesting...Very interesting. If I were a chemist I'd
be quite interested in the chemical explosive, but moostly I'm wondering if I
can develop a Photonic version that still has a shaped explosion. Not that
area-effect bursts would be that bad, would they? I'm not a soldier, not since
I lost my eye in that sword-duel."

"Wait, so you're saying you're not really a weapons guy."

"No, its just that I've been having more luck drawing Photonic charge out of my
generator and channeling it through specially prepared materials than with
using it as a power source. Converting the photons into useful energy is the
issue, the Photonic Reactor's output is just too high as it is. Every time I
try to turn it to electricity, or use it to boil water, or anything else that
can make things go, the extra equipment just ends up with a hole in it. I had
to install a removable roof in my lab, and get permission from the city council
for the light pollution."

"....Sounds to me like you've already got a weapon there."

"Hmmm...Using a reactor directly as an attack...Intruiging...But I don't have
any spares just lying around. It'd take me a while to make new ones, maybe
weeks."

"Er...It's Zondark. What did you wish to know?"

"I hear you made a Black Hole Gun. We had those in our world, they're awesome,
when they work. I know someone who-"

"OHNONONONONO!! Quantum Singularities are dangerous things! We're still not
sure what the exact effects of the first weapon were! Making another one is not
a good plan. And besides, I only created the Gravitation Lenses and Dimensional
Focuser, in order to better study gravi-dimensional phenomena...safely. It was
Mr Nakamura who weaponised it."

"Damn and fuck! What is with this Nakumomo dude? Why was he coming up with all
the cool shit?"

"Every Intellect is defined by their field of speciality. It's what seperates
us from normal scientists and engineers. Mine is dimensional phenomena and
their detection. My master Menezes is optics. The honorable professors inside
are masters in material-energy interaction. Nakamura was...a gunsmith. He could
take pretty much any set of physical objects or energy source, and find a way
to make it hurt people. It was...a useful skill, given that he was part of the
G-Force field team."

"And he just upped and fell into that big Crack, right when I needed him..."

Zondark looks crestfallen at the dissappointment on your face. "N-now, there
are many other Intellects in Edo! I'm sure someone may be able to assist
you...perhaps. If they have the time. And inclination. And aren't under arrest
for megalomania or other conditions..."

I propose a new power source.

I call it the Elgon Drive.

Using the power of the leftover energy from the Cracks in time -space, sort of
like background cosmic energy, the Elgon Drive in theory can turn this energy
into various useful things. It can make Elgon Beams, which change colors based
on power, or even enable Elgon Speed, which is access to the very background
speed of the universe.

That a good catch there. We should see if he can detect anything strange wave/
particle/etc wise about us and see if he can use to track down the others.

Of course, most of the world will come across as different to his sensors, so
this probably will not work.

Yes, Elgon Particles are simply a odd solution to why gravity is a weaker force
than Electro-Magnetic power, Strong Nuclear Force and Weak Nuclear force. So
long as the universe has gravity and background energy, we should be ready to
go. In Normal universes, it feeds on gravity, producing Anti Gravity (Flight).

Yeah, I do to, but I've been writing Katina as a fairly non-weeaboo person, and
the Intellects are trying to translate everything for her. She's not hopeless
at japanese, but she'd only understand someone if they talked really slowly,
and franky she's just not that patient.

But I guess I can start sneaking the cooler term in here and there.

You apparently misunderstand. I find humor in taking supposedly one-shot topics
and making them work for a living. For instance, there was a lot of chatter
about the benefit of giving Katina a close-assault mecha.
So give her a unicorn mecha. Cheap lols ensue... but I invite you to watch the
last act of Godzilla vs. Destroyah any way. Horn, you know.

Eh, figured it was worth the inquiry. If P, then Q.

Ego as they require something with a mind to focus them (an AI is fine too),

"I've been trying that very thing since the Severing. I've been trying to
locate the source of the various dimensional phenomena involved for almost a
week now, using devices like this Omniscope." Said Omniscope is currently
focused on your bodice again. "But frankly, theres just too much to process
right now! So many different phenomena to sort through, I've discovered
something new every day, but I can't figure out how they all fit together. The
intricacy involved it just too many aspects for one person to handle in a
reasonable timeframe."

"So maybe you should just focus on one then."

"But there are two...Oh, you mean one aspect of the dimensional phenomenon.
Yes, I suppose that would give me a starting point for the rest of them."

Theres a difference between a thread filled in a day and a thread filled in 10
hours.

No. The servants are all non-originals. We LISTED THEM EARLIER.

Well EXCUSE ME, Princess. I couldn't be bothered to wade through assloads of
posts.

Are you sure we can't get moe-loli Dumi, though? She'd be like, a little sister
to us. And we could dress her up in frills and ribbons, and teach her how to
sever a man's spine with a blade of grass! And how to interrogate somebody with
a set of nails!

We went through two threads in about as much time a few weeks ago. You
shouldn't underestimate us.

It'd probably be moe-shota Dumi.

Dumi's a guy, you know.

Well for one the servant thing was discussed in the second planning thread.

As for Dumi... We have no idea what Dumi is right now... Male. Female,
Computer, Lightning-Farting-Rat...

We may end up with a loli!Dumi.
Or the more likely, given his gender, shota!Dumi.
Or possibly sentientmotorbike!Dumi
Fuck, we could even end up with yellowelectricrat!Dumi, we don't have a clue...
