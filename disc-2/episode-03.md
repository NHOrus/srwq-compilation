In our last thread, our heroine Katina Tarask got to know her new allies in anti-kaiju team G-Force, fixed up her wet R-Blade, and not much else because the thread got filled up with discussion of dangerous guns and Exalted characters.

So, moving on.

(And no, the terrible MSpaint cut-and-paste art will never stop).

"Right, our first course of action is to get more firepower for the team. And by 'the team', I mostly mean my R-Blade."

The rest of the G-Force team can't disagree with this sentiment. Kaijo, however, shakes his head. "Just asking for it from our suppliers hasn't gotten us anywhere quickly. We need to start appropriating things directly, going through normal channels won't cut it."

"Sounds like a plan I guess. What scientists do we have that we can tap?"

"Our science corps is the main one. Prof. Kabuto and his Photonic energy science have produced interesting results. He hasn't gotten his reactor working yet, but Yume was using special Photonic bullets on our last missions, and...." He spouts some japanese at the shoeless gunman, who places his hands about four feet apart. "He says the craters were about yay big."

"A start. And theres that Saotome dude and his tranforming metal."

Lord Ogomo grins and unbuckles his watch. He flicks his wrist and he's holding some wierd combination of an axe and a mace. "Yes, the good Professors work in that regard is quite interesting. Not that anyone would dare take my katana off me, but still, useful to own the prototype."

Kaijo nods "And we have Prof. Morimori's Chogokin Formula C, and Zondarks special detecting equipment. Then theres the stuff Nakamura and Meiun left behind, which we haven't really been able to reverse-engineer without them. And....well, we had contacts at the Space Development Corporation..."

"You guys had a space program?"

"Yes, but it was hit by a tidal wave during the Severing. Most of the people were lost, as well as the technology they were trying to stop the R Asteroid with. The place is a disaster zone right now, just like the southern part of the city."

I have a list of possible things put together but most of them seem to be unusable now that I have read just what we have, but first and foremost...

We need to see if Saotome can make the R-Blade a scarf out of that metal stuff. If it can reform fluidly like that, it could be very useful.

WE should probably also take a look at the stuff the other team left behind, just because it is super advanced here, does not mean it was in the SMverse.

"Wild Goose" reminds me of the late-game missiles of the same name in Front Mission 1st.

The reason I settled on "Dawn Kraken" generally lies in both Katina's old School nickname and the fact that we're just starting out in this new world.

Also, as awesome as the R-Boiled will get, I wholly expect it to end as a testbed for our previously discussed originals: the electro-tonfas are a prototype for the Blades of Chaos per >>4749791, the Dawn Kraken has elements the Einsamkeit and Latooni's custom unit (forgot name) can appropriate, and so forth.

You return to the garage where it seems the repairs on the R-Blade are complete. Saotome is in the cockpit, fiddling with controls to test the joints. You hear the rattle of the head vulcans cycling.

Morimori comes up to you. "Your humanoid vehicle is quite impressive. If I might ask, what exactly is it constructed from? I can't identify the alloy, is it something from your world?"

You shrug. "It should just be a Mao Industries Titanium alloy, nothing too special."

"Actually, I'd say it is. Titanium is hard to come by in the Crescent Isles, and hard to process in large amounts. Sendai Metals are one of the few companies which make anything large from it, and they control most of the supply. It's a shame, I was hoping to get some for Chogokin D..."

"Speaking of which, how hard would it be for you to add some of your metal to the R-Blade? Would it help any?"

"Not structurally, but it would be good for handling energy discharges or extreme heat. Plating something of that size, however...I'd need a factory to do."

"How about just affecting the weapons?"

"More doable, but those are some mighty big blades. I'd need to make a plating rig in the back of the garage...Give me a few days, I'll see what I can do."

That's how I decided on it, yes. No being, god or man, could bring harm to Balder. It's reflective of both Latooni's superiority as a pilot and her upbringing as something not to be harmed. The primary weapons are further named for the legend - the rifle on its back, Viscumalbum, is derived from the word for "mistletoe", and the Matricaria was the flower claimed to be modeled after Balder's palate. Draupnir was Odin's golden ring that made nine duplicates of itself every week - it was burned with Balder's body when he died as a tribute.

It'd be a story of one of the Shards finding out about the Desuverse's creation (the hard way, exploration), and how they apply old hardware to new problems (In their universe, for example, no kaiju. Just aliens trying to blow everything up.)

That's the tl;dr version of the idea at least.

He has a list of series about 2/3's down that is called the "Final List".


As far as we know if it's on that list it will probably make an appearance in some way shape or form... Like I said, you will want to talk to Sciencegar privately.

Nanoha is a magical girl franchise where the main is nicknamed the White Devil, everybody else gets some sort of SRW/Gundam/etc. reference to their name, and being blasted with magical laser cannons turns you into the main's friend (or girlfriend, in Fate's case).

There's three series that grow increasingly /m/ with time: Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Nanoha A's (which sees Nanoha become part of an interdimensional magical girl police force), and Nanoha Strikers (which sees her become a ranking officer thereof).

The easiest way to deal with an OtT Shinji is of course to introduce an Asuka figure (not necessarily an actual Asuka.) The hard way is to introduce a Rei, what with the complications she brings automatically.

Re: AT fields, there is no such thing as a perfect defense. However, when a defense is an extension of self and will, there is more than the usual amount of flexibility in HOW it may be applied.

Son, I am disappoint.

I took note that not all plasma leader "selling points" were valid. I agree with that slant. Also, you're apparently not familiar with certain German terms. FLAK is more than shotgun equivalent.
Rainbow Scarf is an extra-long range beam weapon, a melee weapon, and a fashion statement. Breast Crusher meets the physical weapon melee needs, I suspect.

> Also, possibly have the tail have a point-thing at the end then straighten and detach to form a halberd? 

Tail is balance aid, fashion accessory for giant metal ass. Any number of handheld weapons may be added as missions require, but those don't require call-outs in preliminary design suggestions.

One, I did approach the forum with what I thought was a proposal. I'm certainly not the author here.
Two, the physics of semi-controlled remote blades were discussed in the threads I was told to read.
I agreed with some of the comments. The BU retains energy/blade attacks with the Destroyah-style horn, retains the shotgun equivalents in forearms, has a scarf/extreme ranged weapon, makes fast melee attacks a main selling point, and has an eye beam. (I decided to make it a single eye beam because of a certain eyecolor schtick. Heh.)

If there's no interest I won't bother hunting up a scanner, but it seemed that Boatlights Unicorn might meet a couple of humor points.

Possible, and if you hook it up to the Fusion Reactor properly, not that hard to charge. The problem is that the R-Blades wing assemblies could get in the way. You'd have to reprogram the thruster system to avoid it burning off the capacitor during tricky manuvers, and manuverability would be taking a hit.

I was and to a degree still am in favor of moving away from lightning. As I said before, we just stole the Raioh, it wasn't made for us.

I didn't and still don't agree that they should somehow split into six, though.

Professor Kabuto looks admirably at the contents of the 90mm vulcan shell he's cut open to inspect. "Interesting...Very interesting. If I were a chemist I'd be quite interested in the chemical explosive, but moostly I'm wondering if I can develop a Photonic version that still has a shaped explosion. Not that area-effect bursts would be that bad, would they? I'm not a soldier, not since I lost my eye in that sword-duel."

"Wait, so you're saying you're not really a weapons guy."

"No, its just that I've been having more luck drawing Photonic charge out of my generator and channeling it through specially prepared materials than with using it as a power source. Converting the photons into useful energy is the issue, the Photonic Reactor's output is just too high as it is. Every time I try to turn it to electricity, or use it to boil water, or anything else that can make things go, the extra equipment just ends up with a hole in it. I had to install a removable roof in my lab, and get permission from the city council for the light pollution."

You catch Zondark as the young man walked about the yard, waving another telescope-esque thing around in random directions. "Yo, Zoldark, got some questions."

"Er...It's Zondark. What did you wish to know?"

"I hear you made a Black Hole Gun. We had those in our world, they're awesome, when they work. I know someone who-"

"OHNONONONONO!! Quantum Singularities are dangerous things! We're still not sure what the exact effects of the first weapon were! Making another one is not a good plan. And besides, I only created the Gravitation Lenses and Dimensional Focuser, in order to better study gravi-dimensional phenomena...safely. It was Mr Nakamura who weaponised it."

"Damn and fuck! What is with this Nakumomo dude? Why was he coming up with all the cool shit?"

"Every Intellect is defined by their field of speciality. It's what seperates us from normal scientists and engineers. Mine is dimensional phenomena and their detection. My master Menezes is optics. The honorable professors inside are masters in material-energy interaction. Nakamura was...a gunsmith. He could take pretty much any set of physical objects or energy source, and find a way to make it hurt people. It was...a useful skill, given that he was part of the G-Force field team."

"And he just upped and fell into that big Crack, right when I needed him..."

Zondark looks crestfallen at the dissappointment on your face. "N-now, there are many other Intellects in Edo! I'm sure someone may be able to assist you...perhaps. If they have the time. And inclination. And aren't under arrest for megalomania or other conditions..."

I propose a new power source.

I call it the Elgon Drive.

Using the power of the leftover energy from the Cracks in time -space, sort of like background cosmic energy, the Elgon Drive in theory can turn this energy into various useful things. It can make Elgon Beams, which change colors based on power, or even enable Elgon Speed, which is access to the very background speed of the universe.

Yes, Elgon Particles are simply a odd solution to why gravity is a weaker force than Electro-Magnetic power, Strong Nuclear Force and Weak Nuclear force. So long as the universe has gravity and background energy, we should be ready to go. In Normal universes, it feeds on gravity, producing Anti Gravity (Flight).
