# Episode 03

##SRWQ2 Mission 3: If you'd included Fifth Element this would be so much simpler...

In our last thread, our heroine Katina Tarask got to know her new allies in anti-kaiju team G-Force, fixed up her wet R-Blade, and not much else because the thread got filled up with discussion of dangerous guns and Exalted characters.

---

"Right, our first course of action is to get more firepower for the team. And by 'the team', I mostly mean my R-Blade."

The rest of the G-Force team can't disagree with this sentiment. Kaijo, however, shakes his head. "Just asking for it from our suppliers hasn't gotten us anywhere quickly. We need to start appropriating things directly, going through normal channels won't cut it."

"Sounds like a plan I guess. What scientists do we have that we can tap?"

"Our science corps is the main one. Prof. Kabuto and his Photonic energy science have produced interesting results. He hasn't gotten his reactor working yet, but Yume was using special Photonic bullets on our last missions, and..." He spouts some japanese at the shoeless gunman, who places his hands about four feet apart. "He says the craters were about yay big."

"A start. And theres that Saotome dude and his tranforming metal."

Lord Ogomo grins and unbuckles his watch. He flicks his wrist and he's holding some wierd combination of an axe and a mace. "Yes, the good Professors work in that regard is quite interesting. Not that anyone would dare take my katana off me, but still, useful to own the prototype."

Kaijo nods "And we have Prof. Morimori's Chogokin Formula C, and Zondarks special detecting equipment. Then theres the stuff Nakamura and Meiun left behind, which we haven't really been able to reverse-engineer without them. And... well, we had contacts at the Space Development Corporation..."

"You guys had a space program?"

"Yes, but it was hit by a tidal wave during the Severing. Most of the people were lost, as well as the technology they were trying to stop the R Asteroid with. The place is a disaster zone right now, just like the southern part of the city."

---

You return to the garage where it seems the repairs on the R-Blade are complete. Saotome is in the cockpit, fiddling with controls to test the joints. You hear the rattle of the head vulcans cycling.

Morimori comes up to you. "Your humanoid vehicle is quite impressive. If I might ask, what exactly is it constructed from? I can't identify the alloy, is it something from your world?"

You shrug. "It should just be a Mao Industries Titanium alloy, nothing too special."

"Actually, I'd say it is. Titanium is hard to come by in the Crescent Isles, and hard to process in large amounts. Sendai Metals are one of the few companies which make anything large from it, and they control most of the supply. It's a shame, I was hoping to get some for Chogokin D..."

"Speaking of which, how hard would it be for you to add some of your metal to the R-Blade? Would it help any?"

"Not structurally, but it would be good for handling energy discharges or extreme heat. Plating something of that size, however... I'd need a factory to do."

"How about just affecting the weapons?"

"More doable, but those are some mighty big blades. I'd need to make a plating rig in the back of the garage... Give me a few days, I'll see what I can do."

You ponder Professor Morimoris idea. "Hmm... You said the metal was good for handling energy, right?"

"Yes, we had good results with the Photonic Magnum young Yume was testing. Any normal gun firing Photonically charged rounds would have exploded, but it performed admirably."

"What about electricity? Could you make it conduct lightning into whatever it stabbed?"

"Why, it might be possible... But you'd need a massive electricity discharge to have any noticable effect. A capacitor that large would be rather bulky, I'd imagine..."

"Hmm, ok, keep my posted on your ideas."

you still lack the Blades though, which are one of the main selling points of the suit...

Close. Pilot compartment is (in theory) most important part of machine, so chest ought to be heavily armored. This would simply be heavily armored metal breasts, taking advantage of both female vanity and the superior ballistics of curved armor.
The mecha dashes straight into an enemy and smashes it with its tits.

Professor Saotome seems rather intruiged by the various controls of the R-Blade. "Quite a complex apparatus...I assume you need a very precise computator to handle the motion issues?"

"Yeah, pretty much. Listen, I hear you're working on shape-changing metal?"

"Yes, it's my current major project. Why, looking for a sample? You look like a woman who'd appreciate some accessories that turn into deadly weapons."

"Well, yeah, but I'm thinking more for the R-Blade here. Some kind of scarf, or something, that can become...useful, when I need it to."

"That'd be a lot of material to work with. I'd need to upsize the Gate Transfuser to make something that size. And if you're away from a source of G-Eta particles, you'll only have one alternate form for the metal. Creating some sort of....G-Eta Reactor? I'm not sure I can do that currently...Or that I'd want to. I'm still learning the ropes on this procedure."

One, I did approach the forum with what I thought was a proposal. I'm certainly not the author here.
Two, the physics of semi-controlled remote blades were discussed in the threads I was told to read.
I agreed with some of the comments. The BU retains energy/blade attacks with the Destroyah-style horn, retains the shotgun equivalents in forearms, has a scarf/extreme ranged weapon, makes fast melee attacks a main selling point, and has an eye beam. (I decided to make it a single eye beam because of a certain eyecolor schtick. Heh.)

If there's no interest I won't bother hunting up a scanner, but it seemed that Boatlights Unicorn might meet a couple of humor points.

Possible, and if you hook it up to the Fusion Reactor properly, not that hard to charge. The problem is that the R-Blades wing assemblies could get in the way. You'd have to reprogram the thruster system to avoid it burning off the capacitor during tricky manuvers, and manuverability would be taking a hit.

Unless some intellect happens to have developed super-mini-capacitors, of course.

Pretty much, yeah. Kaiju are big and unwieldly most of the time. With a weapon like the scarf it gives us a useful tool for tripping up and entangling our target while we stab it to death with The Tonfa's.

No. Do Not Want. Getter leads to fuckery, and not the kind that solves your problems. Well, if you want to get technical, it -will- solve the problems you had -before- you accidentally the Getter, but those problems will likely seem kind of small in hindsight.

I've got no problem with the memory alloy scarf, though. Remember Wodan still needs a Zankantou, so here's the opportunity to pick up the technology for him.

>>4751982
I was and to a degree still am in favor of moving away from lightning. As I said before, we just stole the Raioh, it wasn't made for us. There's a very strong movement to keep it, though, thus the compromise on making the Plasma Tonfa function as electrified Blades of Chaos. I didn't and still don't agree that they should somehow split into six, though. The mental image of actually wielding that is hard to process, and it will likely lead to shenanigans, indecision during combat, or both.

Professor Kabuto looks admirably at the contents of the 90mm vulcan shell he's cut open to inspect. "Interesting...Very interesting. If I were a chemist I'd be quite interested in the chemical explosive, but moostly I'm wondering if I can develop a Photonic version that still has a shaped explosion. Not that area-effect bursts would be that bad, would they? I'm not a soldier, not since I lost my eye in that sword-duel."

"Wait, so you're saying you're not really a weapons guy."

"No, its just that I've been having more luck drawing Photonic charge out of my generator and channeling it through specially prepared materials than with using it as a power source. Converting the photons into useful energy is the issue, the Photonic Reactor's output is just too high as it is. Every time I try to turn it to electricity, or use it to boil water, or anything else that can make things go, the extra equipment just ends up with a hole in it. I had to install a removable roof in my lab, and get permission from the city council for the light pollution."

"....Sounds to me like you've already got a weapon there."

"Hmmm...Using a reactor directly as an attack...Intruiging...But I don't have any spares just lying around. It'd take me a while to make new ones, maybe weeks."

And besides, I only created the Gravitation Lenses and Dimensional Focuser, in order to better study gravi-dimensional phenomena...safely. It was Mr Nakamura who weaponised it."

"Damn and fuck! What is with this Nakumomo dude? Why was he coming up with all the cool shit?"

Using the power of the leftover energy from the Cracks in time -space, sort of like background cosmic energy, the Elgon Drive in theory can turn this energy into various useful things. It can make Elgon Beams, which change colors based on power, or even enable Elgon Speed, which is access to the very background speed of the universe.

Yes, Elgon Particles are simply a odd solution to why gravity is a weaker force than Electro-Magnetic power, Strong Nuclear Force and Weak Nuclear force. So long as the universe has gravity and background energy, we should be ready to go. In Normal universes, it feeds on gravity, producing Anti Gravity (Flight).

Ego + Longevity.
Ego as they require something with a mind to focus them (an AI is fine too), and Longevity, as they use energy from the oldest part of the universe.

There, we got something special that isn't stealing from a Canon character. Does that sound ok?

More or yes, that is correct. I was thinking on this problem. Why is gravity so much weaker than the other forces? Then I realized, that could be used as the basis for SCIENCE!

"Wait, you said you know dimensional stuff, right? Does that mean you can figure out whats what in this new world?"

"I've been trying that very thing since the Severing. I've been trying to locate the source of the various dimensional phenomena involved for almost a week now, using devices like this Omniscope." Said Omniscope is currently focused on your bodice again. "But frankly, theres just too much to process right now! So many different phenomena to sort through, I've discovered something new every day, but I can't figure out how they all fit together. The intricacy involved it just too many aspects for one person to handle in a reasonable timeframe."

"So maybe you should just focus on one then."

"But there are two...Oh, you mean one aspect of the dimensional phenomenon. Yes, I suppose that would give me a starting point for the rest of them."

"God, this should be the most basic common sense..."

"Who?"

It's probably not going to work due to the fact that he 1) has no idea what to look for, and 2) most of the world probably has different dimensional signatures.

I'm not saying we shouldn't try, just don't get your hopes up.

Are you sure we can't get moe-loli Dumi, though? She'd be like, a little sister to us. And we could dress her up in frills and ribbons, and teach her how to sever a man's spine with a blade of grass! And how to interrogate somebody with a set of nails!
