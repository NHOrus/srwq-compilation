Last thread, our heroine Katina Tarask attempted to get her R-Blade upgraded
with Toholon superscience. More would have happened, but the thread hit
autosage AGAIN, due to more Exalted discussion (Not helping the case that the
thread doesn't belong on /tg/, guys), some talk of Nasuverse physics, and talk
of whether including a fanfic version of Shinji would be wise.

I've said it before, I'll say it again...I've unleashed a monster.

Ok, not going to dwell overlong on setup, since you all are obviously clicking
f5 furiously to see my updates from the last thread...

KATINA DECISION POINT:

1) We have Zondark and his many instruments which can apparently detect
dimensional stuff. What exactly will we have him look for?

2) The three scientists have raised several possibilities for upgrades to the
R-Blade. Which will we have them concentrate on doing first?

3) Possibly most important: What will Katina do while she's waiting for these
guys to get back to her?

PLACE YOUR VOTES GENTLEMEN!

No, its fine. Its something different from standard SRW fare, and I do like the
Exalted setting. It's the game mechanics I can't stand (and not even from a
game construction standpoint. If Exalted were a videogame I'd be all over that
shit. It's from a playing and GMing standpoint they annoy me).

1)Give him our com unit

2)Scarves for the mech and Katina

3)Look for something interesting. Possibly grab a swimsuit and beach tiem?

Also Bioware really should make an Exalted game. It would be so very awesome.

Give Zondark Dumi's com unit and tell him to try and track down the signal.
Tell him not to damage the com as it is all we have left of our friends and
family.

>2) The three scientists have raised several possibilities for upgrades to the

Scarf First followed by the Blades.

Not sure, gonna see what the others come up with.

1) Hand over the Comm, it's probably our best link to anyone from our world and
DUMI.

2)Whatever increases the R-Blades defense the most. We've been in a tanky
Super, now where stuck in a lightly armored real.

3)Investigate local prison for anyone else that might have washed up here.

And here is a further addenum to the "Going to the Prison" Plan.

Make sure we bring someone with us to both Translate, and with enough power to
get someone out in case we find a friend (for example Coop), or find should we
a person of interest that may be useful to us (For Example Van).

I agree with giving Zondark our com unit. If he can't do anything with it, see
if he can find the Thrudgelmir.

I vote bad ass scarf, it's something we can use on most mechs we create/receive
and can be passed to other people if need be.

Katina will do what she needs to do now that she has everything readied. She
will requisition booze money and drink till late at night, sleep in at the
base, wake up to find Zondark peeking through the crack in her door, either
tease him or tell him to GTFO, then either go back to bed or bleerily scrounge
up some sort of edibles.

Fair enough.

This raises the question of: will there be Baron Ashura?

Because if so, expect trolling.

It'll be the goodguy Hell and Ashura from the Mazinkaiser manga, and they will

Wait, there have been goodguy versions? Huh, didn't know that.


Anyway, it appears that most of us agree on the first two, it's the third one

Not really sure how I feel about us going and basing it off of Knightblazer in
terms of appearance, but whatever works I guess.

Are we really going to get a horn though? I thought the horn was scrapped
yesterday when it was revealed that the anon talking about that was trying to
make a BU mech?

Yeah, the tail does not make much sense either... Only reason I was even
entertaining the idea was for the Zankantou idea, but if we want a Zankantou,
we can just have that be the normal Alt-mode of the Scarf.

I actually agree here. A zankantou is too slow of a weapon.

You pull the tiny earpiece out and hand it to Zondark. "Bian, this is a special
interdimensional radio, and I need to talk to the guy on the other side. Last
time I tried, I got gibberish. Can you maybe trace the signal, see where my
friend is? If you find him, he'll be a big help to you."

"What did you call me?"

"Just take the damn thing!"

You jog back into the hangar and face the scientists. "Right, I've decided I
need weapons the most right now. I say you all concentrate on Saotomes idea,
making some kind of scarf that turns into a weapon. Do that first."

Saotome rubs his chin. "I'll need to make a scaled-down version first to test
the concept..."

"Perfect!! I'll be happy to test that too!"

"Alright then, we have a plan it seems."

You head into the main building and find Kaijo signing of on something at the
main desk. "Kaijo, if something wierd where to was up on the island, and you
didn't find it first, where it/he/she end up?"

"A good question....Give me 20 minutes on the Telephone, I might be able to
find something on that regard..."

I just had two idea, one of them more sensible than the other. Neither of them
have shit to do with the design of the Algol.

First Thing: We need to build a collection of weapons that we can sortie with.
We should start looting weapons from all major mechs we shoot down. We also
need to loot parts from Kaiju we take down and use the pieces to create new
melee weapons for us to possibly use. Imagine a Mech Scale shank made from the
horn of Destroyah.

Second Thing: If we ever end up working with Van after we get the Algol, even
for a single battle, We need to use the Dann as a Sword in it's altmode at
least once.

Isn't Dann a little big for that? What size is its sword mode? The Algols only

It's pretty good. Same director that did S-Cry-Ed and Code Geass. If you hate
Suzaku you have a character on the bad guys side that has the same voice actor
and is somewhat similar.

Basic revenge story plot. No BS Van get's pissed off and get's his revenge end

About half an hour later, a white tracked vehicle, like some odd combination of
Limo and Tank rolls up in front of the G-Force HQ. A middle-aged man in a
loosely-fastened shirt gets out. At least he looks middle-aged, it could just
be the scars and the world-weary expression. You and Maki head out to meet him.

"Jin."

"Maki. This is your Unknown Gaijin?"

You frown at this. "Hey! I'm as native to this world as you, buster!"

"Maybe you are, but the people who come up with the names for things told us to
call people from the new continents that. And I don't have the energy to ask
them to be more polite. Now, what are you here for?"

"I'm just trying to find my friends! If you've got any of them, you hand them
over right away!"

"I doubt it. Are your friends from space? Are they Colored?"

"Ugh...Wait, 'Colored'? Are you seriously that unsubtle about race?"

"Missy, in Toholon, being a different race means you could be a 7-foot-tall
lizardman who can bite a mans face off in one chomp. Racial sensitivity isn't
terribly high."

Kaijo steps between the two of you. "Don't get flustered people. G-Force is
offering to handle more of the people from the new lands, since we've got one
already. To take them off your departments hands, Jin, so you can concentrate
on the bigger picture. Please, Jin, it'll benefit both of our groups."

"After the mess you made of the Varan incident, I'm not going to hand
everything over to you second-tier layabouts. But our resources are
stretched...you get one. You can either take the woman from the space capsule,
or the colored male who washed up in the mechanical giant. Or one of their
machines. We keep the rest."

WILL KATINA TAKE ANY OF THESE OPTIONS, OR WILL SHE ASK SOMETHING ELSE?

"You can't expect me to make a choice like that blindly! Let me see them
first."

"Sorry, missy, but they're being stored in a location where we don't just let
people in and out. If you want clearance on getting in for a visit, you're
looking at a weeks wait minimum, and even then, only Maki would be allowed in
due to his past with us. Getting them released to your custody is a lot easier,

"That's bullshit!"

I'd rather not ginx it, but looking at the series list there are not many
people it could be.

He mentioned that the woman showed up in a space capsule, and that there was
more than one mech between the pair.

Now who do we know WILL be present in the game that has a mech and could have a
reason to be in a space capsule?

"Woman, early twenties. Speaks Crescentian and Caladosian, calls them
"japanese" and "english". Landed off the northern coast in a space capsule much
like the ones the SDC used to have. Claims to have been living in some kind of
space-ship. The others a colored guy about the same age, speaks Caladosian with
an atrocious accent. Claims to work for some kind of company, was scouting our
island when his mechanical giant was attacked by bugs."

"Bugs?"

"G-Force should have a file on them. We can send you one to autopsy if you
like, but we know you don't have a proper biologist yet. Seems like an
oversight if you ask me."

Kaijo smirks. "Jin, you know better than anyone that half the biologists on the
island work for that bastard Gasha behind the scenes."

"Given that you've employed an Atlantean seditionist, 2 talking moths, a
lizardman and two known pirates in the past few months, I didn't think you were
that picky."

You cut in again. "Any more details?"

"No."

Out of those two, I would say we will probably have better luck with the Woman.
I doubt she is anyone we know, but since she was on a ship, she COULD be
someone. And I would rather not leave her there to get poked and prodded when
we could get her out of there.

(/m/, voting for the boobs. I'm shocked.)

It's late in the evening when the white Limo Raider returns, and Jin emerges
with a young woman. He removes her handcuffs and turns to Mr. Mireniamu, who
signs off on a series of forms.

"Agent Jin, I wish you could be more trusting of G-Force. Cooperation between
our two departments can only be beneficial."

"Sorry, trust is at a premium in my line of work. Just make sure you get
something useful from all this 'cooperation', then we'll see if G-Force really
is worth the scraps the High Intellect throws at it."

You run past and look the new arrival up and down. "Dammit, I don't recognise
you at all...Tell me you're from a sane world, with proper giant robots and
food made out of pork scratchings and pig dung extract."

The woman looks behind her as the Limo Raider drives away. "I'm sorry, but I'm
still trying to take all of this in...I'm Akane Ardygun, I'm a Trailer...You
know what a Trailer is, right?"

"Ugh....Something rednecks live in?"

The young woman sighs.

"It's the same all over, Akane. Chill out, we're at least 50% less likely to
molest you than those other guys. Thats a start, right?"

"Warter, Warter...Nope, doesn't ring a bell."

"The Gutsy Geoid Guard? The Space Knights? Mithril?"

"....Do you know the Divine Crusaders? The Inspectors? The Shadow Mirrors?"

Akane grunts in annoyance. "We must be from completely different worlds..."

"Not that different. We both have proper technology, and use robots. Thats a
start."

"I was hoping you might know some more counterparts..."

"Counterparts? Like alternate versions of people in different worlds?"

"Yes! You understand! I tried explaining to that Hayato Jin I knew another
version of him, but he didn't get it...But I suppose it'd be too much to start
listing off people."

"Don't worry, if any of your friends made the jump with you, we'll find them
just like mine."

Akane's face wrinkles up with concern. "But...Our ship was caught in the centre
of the Dark Exa Nova...We all had to eject while the dimensional distortion was
happening. They could be scattered over half the galaxy..."

"Don't you worry, Big Sis Katina will sort it all out! I know people, they

Zondark stares blankly at the wall, then slowly turns his neck towards you. His
expression is that same dread panic that forced you to punch him, but frozen in
place.

"W-w-w-well....It's not every d-day...you get a message from beyond..."

"You got a message? SWEET!! What is it, tell me tell me!!!"

Zondark, hands shaking, turns to a gramaphone-like thing connected by glass
tubes and lenses to one of his telescopes, which is peering into the gubbins of
your earpiece. "Words...from the planes beyond...And the worst thing
is...they're legible..."

He flips a switch. Your heart leaps as a familiar voice cuts through the quiet
of the lab.

Doubtful, the Valstork team seem to have formed Valzacard.

I think it might be leftover remnants of Dark Brain, or something altogether
more...Lovecraftian.

Zondarks hands are still shaking. "Y-y-you know that thing?? H-how?
It's....Beyond!!"

"Will you pull yourself together, you dipshit!! Or do you want me to break your
nose properly this time?"

"O-ok...But I traced the s-source of that transmission...It's not on this
dimensional plane. It's in counterphase to this whole mess that makes up this
world?"

"What? But Dumi said....How could he be in another dimension when he came the
same way as the rest of us?"

"I-I couldn't tell you that...But its not really another dimension, I
think...It'd be more, the underpinnings of this one. It's the plane underneath
with one, from an N-dimensional point of view anyway."

"What? Like...Heaven, or Hell or something?"

"I...don't know those terms."

"Never mind.....How would we even get there?"

"Er, well your friend said something about a computator that worked on
dimensional principles...Which is a concept I wouldn't even be close to
imagining, let alone creating."

Akane puts a hand on your shoulder. "Maybe we should rest on this, and think
about it in the morning. Alright?"

WILL KATINA SLEEP, OR DOES SHE HAVE MORE TO DO TONIGHT? Its going on 10pm at
this point.

First, utterly destroy the earpiece if we haven't already.

Then go get drunk with Akane. I've got the feeling we might be needing the
Valzacard's dimensional hax to find Dumi...

The hammer falls again and again, each blow accentuated with a tear. Soon
theres nothing left of the earpiece but a fine film, but the tears don't. You
point at Professor Kabuto, then at the smudge. "Destroy that. Melt it with your
photonic thingy. I need alcohol."

"Diiiid someone say alcohol?" The elf Nozumi appears as if from nowhere.

"Do you know somewhere to get totally sloshed very quickly?"

"I know every drinking hole in this half of the city. Some of them, I keep in
business singlehandedly."

"Awesome. Come on Akane, we're gonna have a heart-to-heart."

Kuso = JPN equiv. "Damn" or "Shit."
WARE KOSO WA = Archaic and samurai-esque way of saying "My name is," e.g. "Ware
koso wa Baran Doban" - "I am Baran Doban."
Thus, "WARE KUSO WA ___" = Traditionalist way of stating your name while
proclaiming that you are (insert preferred profanity here).

Upon further review, ONORE KOSO WA doesn't work either, since "damn you" is
replacing the first-person identifier.

There's nothing there to override, it just replaces All Riders Together.

Right, what Zeta Zaku said. Let's try to worry about what's going on right NOW
rather than what happened a while ago. Or things that are entirely unrelated.

The bar is a hole in the earth, literally. Ensconced in the cellar of a cheese
shop, the walls are barely covered by wooden slats, and the threadbare carpet
fails to hide that the foundation blocks in the floor are uneven. It suits your
mood quite well.

Nozumi returns to the table with your drinks, and begins gulping down a foul
concoction that seems to have taken a fairly chunk out of his wallet.

You raise an eyebrow. "Is that...?"

"It's an Itoshi clan speciality, the Toast to Good Health. It's a secret recipe
we've passed down for 2300 y-"

"A shot of vodka, one of gin, one of rum and two of scotch, and a slice of
lemon."

"...How did you know that?"

You sip at your sake and grin. "I knew a girl who used to drink much the same
thing...Yeah, you do look a lot like her, without the massive boobs anyway."

Akane frowns. "So I am right...There are counterparts to different people
throughout this world...It's a mirror to mine and yours."

"More like pieces of different mirrors, all glued together to make a new one.
You won't get a good reflection, but you will get an interesting one."

"But how? How would we all end up here, on one planet made of pieces? Is it
just chance, or did something make it this way?

HOW WILL KATINA RESPOND TO THAT?

Frown, and point out that the odds of so many disorganized Shards from vastly
different worlds coming together are -astronomical-. There's no precedent for
this, as far as Katina's willing to admit, so there must be some force at work
here. And we intend to find out what it is.

In short, drop a bit of the truth to lead them in the right direction, but
leave out our involvement. And if we're asked how we know so much about this,
say that booze helps us think.

Gah. This causes me a SRWQG (SRWQ Gaiden... working name, I guess?) problem,
and the only way I can consider solving it is to say each world/universe/Shard
reacted differently to it's Sharding.

I suppose you're right about that.

Just that SRWQG states that Sharded universes are stuck in a 24-hour time loop.
Or at least that's the plan.

Wait, They WERE caught in a timeloop or they ARE? Are you talking about the
time between the actual Severing, and them being stitched into the new world,
or are they still Groundhogging even after the New World gets fixed up?

If its just the former, that while waiting for the Stitching they were in
Groundhog Day Mode, thats fine. My basic idea was that between the shards being
ripped out of the dying universes and stayed in a sort of quantum flux, which
would have been different for each one. Some would have experienced no time in
the void, some years, and potentially some could have been retconned into other
shards or the like.

That is what I am thinking for now. She more than anyone else here is going to
understand how our stuff works, and will probably understand what the R-blade
is capable of.

She would make a wonderful partner, even if she is just watching from the
background and keeping us updated on what is happening around us.

He's got a point. As of late, every thread has been about 30% quest, 40-50%
speculation, and about 20-30% unrelated ramblings. It'd be ideal if we could
reach a balance like the /m/erotica threads, where we can keep a steady rhythm
of bumps just to keep it from dropping off the board. We have 15 pages now,
they're not going to fade anytime soon, especially with how slow we move
compared to other boards.

I'd really not like to clutter /m/ any more then we have to. Separate threads
would just antagonize people who don't like this even more.

It's mostly because we spend some time coming up with what to do, finish with
that, wait for sciencegar to update, move on to speculation to alieviate
boredom and bump the thread while waiting for sciencegar to update, then when
we run out of stuff to speculate about and finally start rambling.

"Katina!!!"

You grunt as you're rudely jostled. You absentmindedly reach around, knocking
over the three empty Sake pots. You think Nozumi and you were about even on
those. It's the extra bottle of Sienan Vodka that did for you.

"Katina!! There's something outside! Something big!! We've gotta go!!" It's
that new girl, Acorn or something.

"Riiigh', righ', ah'll fix't." You stumble up to a standing position as only
someone entirely inebriated can do, and fall-run to the stairs. You clamber up
the steps of the bar and onto the street, and see something large and black on
the next street over, standing out in the darkness mainly by dint of not
looking real at all.

"Fuck, this movi's got TERRIBLE effects! TERRBILE!"

A roar from a million miles behind you. "It's an Arm Arcus Finis! What is it
doing here? And why does it look so odd?"

"D'rector spend the CGI bujjit on coke'n'whores, 's'my guess. Oh wait, this
isn't a movie..."

Nozumi, equally as drunk as you, is chasing after the thing, screaming and
waving his harpoon wildly in the air.

The unreal mech doesn't seem to be doing much, its just walking down the
street. Of course, its steps cause buildings to shake and windows to crack, so
apparently it weighs something.

WHAT WILL OUR BOOZEHOUND DO?

Arm Arcus Finis...one of the Database's Aria clones? Somehow I doubt talking to
it will do much good...unless it was already stolen by someone.

Either way, stagger off to the R-Blade and try not to cause more damage then
it's already doing as we follow the example of Roy Fokker and his technique of
Saving The Day While Drunk.

I doubt that it is the Einst... I think it might be something else, something
new to Katina...

Whatever it is, it seems to be out of synch with the rest of reality... Anyone
know any enemies form the games that might pull shit like that?

Katina is way too drunk to analyse it any better. The only thing I'll say is
that it stands out perfectly in the darkness, and its not because of street
lights.

You run along the street, with Akane right behind you, chasing the mech and the
mad elf. The Arcus easily outpaces you all, plodding through the streets of
Edo, smashing windows and popping street lights, but little else. It
occasionally sends light from its eyes into larger buildings, apparently
scanning them for something. Sirens blare across the city, and what few people
were on the streets make for cover. The city seems to have a good number of
shelters and secure structures to take cover in.

The things walks on, up to G-Force HQ. Its scan-beams pass over it, and linger
a while longer than the other buildings, but then it walks over, knocking over
several walls as it goes. You reach the HQ a minute later, overtaking an out-
of-breath Nozumi.

A large man wearing at least 3 belts of grenades leads the G-Force Security
Team to secure the grounds. "Ready all explosives! If it comes back this way,
fire everything! And if you die, curse those cheapskates in the army for not
giving you bigger guns!"

You ignore the lightly armed guards and head over to the R-Blade, which is now
standing in the yard. Saotome hops down from the cockpit. "I've gotten it
warmed up for you. Sure you're fit to fly it?"

"'m too drunk to answers that kestion wi'out bias."

"...I'm sure you'll do fine."

The R-Blade boots up, and turns to face the black mech, which is headed to the
city centre, and the few skyscrapers in this old-timey city. Your radar
registers planes and tanks coming from the north.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?
