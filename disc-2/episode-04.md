# Episode 04

##SRWQ2 Mission 4: 300 posts is no longer enough, it seems.

Last episode, our heroine Katina Tarask attempted to get her R-Blade upgraded with Toholon superscience. More would have happened, but the source thread hit autosage AGAIN, due to more Exalted discussion, some talk of Nasuverse physics, and talk of whether including a fanfic version of Shinji would be wise.

I've said it before, I'll say it again... I've unleashed a monster.

---

You pull the tiny earpiece out and hand it to Zondark. "Bian, this is a special interdimensional radio, and I need to talk to the guy on the other side. Last time I tried, I got gibberish. Can you maybe trace the signal, see where my friend is? If you find him, he'll be a big help to you."

"What did you call me?"

"Just take the damn thing!"

You jog back into the hangar and face the scientists. "Right, I've decided I need weapons the most right now. I say you all concentrate on Saotomes idea, making some kind of scarf that turns into a weapon. Do that first."

Saotome rubs his chin. "I'll need to make a scaled-down version first to test the concept..."

"Perfect!! I'll be happy to test that too!"

"Alright then, we have a plan it seems."

You head into the main building and find Kaijo signing of on something at the main desk. "Kaijo, if something wierd where to was up on the island, and you didn't find it first, where it/he/she end up?"

"A good question... Give me 20 minutes on the Telephone, I might be able to find something on that regard..."

---

About half an hour later, a white tracked vehicle, like some odd combination of Limo and Tank rolls up in front of the G-Force HQ. A middle-aged man in a loosely-fastened shirt gets out. At least he looks middle-aged, it could just be the scars and the world-weary expression. You and Maki head out to meet him.

"Jin."

"Maki. This is your Unknown Gaijin?"

You frown at this. "Hey! I'm as native to this world as you, buster!"

"Maybe you are, but the people who come up with the names for things told us to call people from the new continents that. And I don't have the energy to ask them to be more polite. Now, what are you here for?"

"I'm just trying to find my friends! If you've got any of them, you hand them over right away!"

"I doubt it. Are your friends from space? Are they Colored?"

"Ugh...Wait, 'Colored'? Are you seriously that unsubtle about race?"

"Missy, in Toholon, being a different race means you could be a 7-foot-tall lizardman who can bite a mans face off in one chomp. Racial sensitivity isn't terribly high."

Kaijo steps between the two of you. "Don't get flustered people. G-Force is offering to handle more of the people from the new lands, since we've got one already. To take them off your departments hands, Jin, so you can concentrate on the bigger picture. Please, Jin, it'll benefit both of our groups."

"After the mess you made of the Varan incident, I'm not going to hand everything over to you second-tier layabouts. But our resources are stretched... you get one. You can either take the woman from the space capsule, or the colored male who washed up in the mechanical giant. Or one of their machines. We keep the rest."

"You can't expect me to make a choice like that blindly! Let me see them first."

"Sorry, missy, but they're being stored in a location where we don't just let people in and out. If you want clearance on getting in for a visit, you're looking at a weeks wait minimum, and even then, only Maki would be allowed in due to his past with us. Getting them released to your custody is a lot easier, beleive me."

"That's bullshit!"

"That's the rules. Deal with it."

"Woman, early twenties. Speaks Crescentian and Caladosian, calls them "japanese" and "english". Landed off the northern coast in a space capsule much like the ones the SDC used to have. Claims to have been living in some kind of space-ship. The others a colored guy about the same age, speaks Caladosian with an atrocious accent. Claims to work for some kind of company, was scouting our island when his mechanical giant was attacked by bugs."

"Bugs?"

"G-Force should have a file on them. We can send you one to autopsy if you like, but we know you don't have a proper biologist yet. Seems like an oversight if you ask me."

Kaijo smirks. "Jin, you know better than anyone that half the biologists on the island work for that bastard Gasha behind the scenes."

"Given that you've employed an Atlantean seditionist, 2 talking moths, a lizardman and two known pirates in the past few months, I didn't think you were that picky."

You cut in again. "Any more details?"

"No."

---

It's late in the evening when the white Limo Raider returns, and Jin emerges with a young woman. He removes her handcuffs and turns to Mr. Mireniamu, who signs off on a series of forms.

"Agent Jin, I wish you could be more trusting of G-Force. Cooperation between our two departments can only be beneficial."

"Sorry, trust is at a premium in my line of work. Just make sure you get something useful from all this 'cooperation', then we'll see if G-Force really is worth the scraps the High Intellect throws at it."

You run past and look the new arrival up and down. "Dammit, I don't recognise you at all... Tell me you're from a sane world, with proper giant robots and food made out of pork scratchings and pig dung extract."

The woman looks behind her as the Limo Raider drives away. "I'm sorry, but I'm still trying to take all of this in... I'm Akane Ardygun, I'm a Trailer... You know what a Trailer is, right?"

"Ugh... Something rednecks live in?"

The young woman sighs.

"It's the same all over, Akane. Chill out, we're at least 50% less likely to molest you than those other guys. Thats a start, right?"

---

"Warter, Warter... Nope, doesn't ring a bell."

"The Gutsy Geoid Guard? The Space Knights? Mithril?"

"...Do you know the Divine Crusaders? The Inspectors? The Shadow Mirrors?"

Akane grunts in annoyance. "We must be from completely different worlds..."

"Not that different. We both have proper technology, and use robots. Thats a start."

"I was hoping you might know some more counterparts..."

"Counterparts? Like alternate versions of people in different worlds?"

"Yes! You understand! I tried explaining to that Hayato Jin I knew another version of him, but he didn't get it... But I suppose it'd be too much to start listing off people."

"Don't worry, if any of your friends made the jump with you, we'll find them just like mine."

Akane's face wrinkles up with concern. "But... Our ship was caught in the centre of the Dark Exa Nova... We all had to eject while the dimensional distortion was happening. They could be scattered over half the galaxy..."

"Don't you worry, Big Sis Katina will sort it all out! I know people, they should be able to help you out... Speaking of which, what did that Zondark dude find out?"

---

Zondark stares blankly at the wall, then slowly turns his neck towards you. His expression is that same dread panic that forced you to punch him, but frozen in place.

"W-w-w-well... It's not every d-day... you get a message from beyond..."

"You got a message? SWEET!! What is it, tell me tell me!!!"

Zondark, hands shaking, turns to a gramaphone-like thing connected by glass tubes and lenses to one of his telescopes, which is peering into the gubbins of your earpiece. "Words... from the planes beyond... And the worst thing is... they're legible..."

He flips a switch. Your heart leaps as a familiar voice cuts through the quiet of the lab.

*Katina, destroy the earpiece. They'll use it to track you. You can't find me with it, you'll need a multidimensional computer, than can upload or download between the realms. There should be several, they adjusted the Shards to make sure they had a way. Use that against them, use it to find me, before they figure out what they are.*

"...GOD. FUCKING. DAMMIT!!! DUMI, YOU OBTUSE SHITHEAD!!!!"

Zondarks hands are still shaking. "Y-y-you know that thing?? H-how? It's... Beyond!!"

"Will you pull yourself together, you dipshit!! Or do you want me to break your nose properly this time?"

"O-ok... But I traced the s-source of that transmission... It's not on this dimensional plane. It's in counterphase to this whole mess that makes up this world?"

"What? But Dumi said... How could he be in another dimension when he came the same way as the rest of us?"

"I-I couldn't tell you that... But its not really another dimension, I think... It'd be more, the underpinnings of this one. It's the plane underneath with one, from an N-dimensional point of view anyway."

"What? Like... Heaven, or Hell or something?"

"I... don't know those terms."

"Never mind... How would we even get there?"

"Er, well your friend said something about a computator that worked on dimensional principles... Which is a concept I wouldn't even be close to imagining, let alone creating."

Akane puts a hand on your shoulder. "Maybe we should rest on this, and think about it in the morning. Alright?"

---

The hammer falls again and again, each blow accentuated with a tear. Soon theres nothing left of the earpiece but a fine film, but the tears don't. You point at Professor Kabuto, then at the smudge. "Destroy that. Melt it with your photonic thingy. I need alcohol."

"Diiiid someone say alcohol?" The elf Nozumi appears as if from nowhere.

"Do you know somewhere to get totally sloshed very quickly?"

"I know every drinking hole in this half of the city. Some of them, I keep in business singlehandedly."

"Awesome. Come on Akane, we're gonna have a heart-to-heart."

Well, the whole EVERYTHING GOES WRONG IN THE MOST AWESOME WAY POSSIBLE thing is part of why this Quest is so popular. Its been happening ever since the Irregulars booted Vindel out of the portal.

Sciencegar really knows how to clusterfuck, and most importantly how to make it -fun-. After all, judging by Dumi's message, our 'simple' plan has really gone off the rails...

Kuso = JPN equiv. "Damn" or "Shit."
WARE KOSO WA = Archaic and samurai-esque way of saying "My name is," e.g. "Ware koso wa Baran Doban" - "I am Baran Doban."
Thus, "WARE KUSO WA ___" = Traditionalist way of stating your name while proclaiming that you are (insert preferred profanity here).

Upon further review, ONORE KOSO WA doesn't work either, since "damn you" is replacing the first-person identifier.

The bar is a hole in the earth, literally. Ensconced in the cellar of a cheese shop, the walls are barely covered by wooden slats, and the threadbare carpet fails to hide that the foundation blocks in the floor are uneven. It suits your mood quite well.

Nozumi returns to the table with your drinks, and begins gulping down a foul concoction that seems to have taken a fairly chunk out of his wallet.

You raise an eyebrow. "Is that...?"

"It's an Itoshi clan speciality, the Toast to Good Health. It's a secret recipe we've passed down for 2300 y-"

"A shot of vodka, one of gin, one of rum and two of scotch, and a slice of lemon."

"...How did you know that?"

You sip at your sake and grin. "I knew a girl who used to drink much the same thing...Yeah, you do look a lot like her, without the massive boobs anyway."

Akane frowns. "So I am right...There are counterparts to different people throughout this world...It's a mirror to mine and yours."

"More like pieces of different mirrors, all glued together to make a new one. You won't get a good reflection, but you will get an interesting one."

"But how? How would we all end up here, on one planet made of pieces? Is it just chance, or did something make it this way?

HOW WILL KATINA RESPOND TO THAT?

Frown, and point out that the odds of so many disorganized Shards from vastly different worlds coming together are -astronomical-. There's no precedent for this, as far as Katina's willing to admit, so there must be some force at work here. And we intend to find out what it is.

In short, drop a bit of the truth to lead them in the right direction, but leave out our involvement. And if we're asked how we know so much about this, say that booze helps us think.

Gah. This causes me a SRWQG (SRWQ Gaiden... working name, I guess?) problem, and the only way I can consider solving it is to say each world/universe/Shard reacted differently to it's Sharding.

Wait, They WERE caught in a timeloop or they ARE? Are you talking about the time between the actual Severing, and them being stitched into the new world, or are they still Groundhogging even after the New World gets fixed up?

If its just the former, that while waiting for the Stitching they were in Groundhog Day Mode, thats fine. My basic idea was that between the shards being ripped out of the dying universes and stayed in a sort of quantum flux, which would have been different for each one. Some would have experienced no time in the void, some years, and potentially some could have been retconned into other shards or the like.

He's got a point. As of late, every thread has been about 30% quest, 40-50% speculation, and about 20-30% unrelated ramblings. It'd be ideal if we could reach a balance like the /m/erotica threads, where we can keep a steady rhythm of bumps just to keep it from dropping off the board.

"Katina!!!"

You grunt as you're rudely jostled. You absentmindedly reach around, knocking over the three empty Sake pots. You think Nozumi and you were about even on those. It's the extra bottle of Sienan Vodka that did for you.

"Katina!! There's something outside! Something big!! We've gotta go!!" It's that new girl, Acorn or something.

"Riiigh', righ', ah'll fix't." You stumble up to a standing position as only someone entirely inebriated can do, and fall-run to the stairs. You clamber up the steps of the bar and onto the street, and see something large and black on the next street over, standing out in the darkness mainly by dint of not looking real at all.

"Fuck, this movi's got TERRIBLE effects! TERRBILE!"

A roar from a million miles behind you. "It's an Arm Arcus Finis! What is it doing here? And why does it look so odd?"

"D'rector spend the CGI bujjit on coke'n'whores, 's'my guess. Oh wait, this isn't a movie..."

Nozumi, equally as drunk as you, is chasing after the thing, screaming and waving his harpoon wildly in the air.

The unreal mech doesn't seem to be doing much, its just walking down the street. Of course, its steps cause buildings to shake and windows to crack, so apparently it weighs something.

You run along the street, with Akane right behind you, chasing the mech and the mad elf. The Arcus easily outpaces you all, plodding through the streets of Edo, smashing windows and popping street lights, but little else. It occasionally sends light from its eyes into larger buildings, apparently scanning them for something. Sirens blare across the city, and what few people were on the streets make for cover. The city seems to have a good number of shelters and secure structures to take cover in.

The things walks on, up to G-Force HQ. Its scan-beams pass over it, and linger a while longer than the other buildings, but then it walks over, knocking over several walls as it goes. You reach the HQ a minute later, overtaking an out-of-breath Nozumi.

A large man wearing at least 3 belts of grenades leads the G-Force Security Team to secure the grounds. "Ready all explosives! If it comes back this way, fire everything! And if you die, curse those cheapskates in the army for not giving you bigger guns!"

You ignore the lightly armed guards and head over to the R-Blade, which is now standing in the yard. Saotome hops down from the cockpit. "I've gotten it warmed up for you. Sure you're fit to fly it?"

"'m too drunk to answers that kestion wi'out bias."

"...I'm sure you'll do fine."

The R-Blade boots up, and turns to face the black mech, which is headed to the city centre, and the few skyscrapers in this old-timey city. Your radar registers planes and tanks coming from the north.
