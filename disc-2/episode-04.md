# Episode 04

##SRWQ2 Mission 4: 300 posts is no longer enough, it seems.

Last episode, our heroine Katina Tarask attempted to get her R-Blade upgraded with Toholon superscience. More would have happened, but the source thread hit autosage AGAIN, due to more Exalted discussion, some talk of Nasuverse physics, and talk of whether including a fanfic version of Shinji would be wise.

I've said it before, I'll say it again... I've unleashed a monster.

Ok, not going to dwell overlong on setup, since you all are obviously clicking f5 furiously to see my updates from the last thread...

KATINA DECISION POINT:

1) We have Zondark and his many instruments which can apparently detect dimensional stuff. What exactly will we have him look for?

2) The three scientists have raised several possibilities for upgrades to the R-Blade. Which will we have them concentrate on doing first?

3) Possibly most important: What will Katina do while she's waiting for these guys to get back to her?

PLACE YOUR VOTES GENTLEMEN!

No, its fine. Its something different from standard SRW fare, and I do like the Exalted setting. It's the game mechanics I can't stand (and not even from a game construction standpoint. If Exalted were a videogame I'd be all over that shit. It's from a playing and GMing standpoint they annoy me).

1)Give him our com unit

2)Scarves for the mech and Katina

3)Look for something interesting. Possibly grab a swimsuit and beach tiem?

Also Bioware really should make an Exalted game. It would be so very awesome.

1) Hand over the Comm, it's probably our best link to anyone from our world and DUMI.

2)Whatever increases the R-Blades defense the most. We've been in a tanky Super, now where stuck in a lightly armored real.

3)Investigate local prison for anyone else that might have washed up here.

I agree with giving Zondark our com unit. If he can't do anything with it, see if he can find the Thrudgelmir.

I vote bad ass scarf, it's something we can use on most mechs we create/receive and can be passed to other people if need be.

Katina will do what she needs to do now that she has everything readied. She will requisition booze money and drink till late at night, sleep in at the base, wake up to find Zondark peeking through the crack in her door, either tease him or tell him to GTFO, then either go back to bed or bleerily scrounge up some sort of edibles.

You pull the tiny earpiece out and hand it to Zondark. "Bian, this is a special interdimensional radio, and I need to talk to the guy on the other side. Last time I tried, I got gibberish. Can you maybe trace the signal, see where my friend is? If you find him, he'll be a big help to you."

"What did you call me?"

"Just take the damn thing!"

You jog back into the hangar and face the scientists. "Right, I've decided I need weapons the most right now. I say you all concentrate on Saotomes idea, making some kind of scarf that turns into a weapon. Do that first."

Saotome rubs his chin. "I'll need to make a scaled-down version first to test the concept..."

"Perfect!! I'll be happy to test that too!"

"Alright then, we have a plan it seems."

You head into the main building and find Kaijo signing of on something at the main desk. "Kaijo, if something wierd where to was up on the island, and you didn't find it first, where it/he/she end up?"

I just had two idea, one of them more sensible than the other. Neither of them have shit to do with the design of the Algol.

First Thing: We need to build a collection of weapons that we can sortie with. We should start looting weapons from all major mechs we shoot down. We also need to loot parts from Kaiju we take down and use the pieces to create new melee weapons for us to possibly use. Imagine a Mech Scale shank made from the horn of Destroyah.

Second Thing: If we ever end up working with Van after we get the Algol, even for a single battle, We need to use the Dann as a Sword in it's altmode at least once.

About half an hour later, a white tracked vehicle, like some odd combination of Limo and Tank rolls up in front of the G-Force HQ. A middle-aged man in a loosely-fastened shirt gets out. At least he looks middle-aged, it could just be the scars and the world-weary expression. You and Maki head out to meet him.

"Jin."

"Maki. This is your Unknown Gaijin?"

You frown at this. "Hey! I'm as native to this world as you, buster!"

"Maybe you are, but the people who come up with the names for things told us to call people from the new continents that. And I don't have the energy to ask them to be more polite. Now, what are you here for?"

"I'm just trying to find my friends! If you've got any of them, you hand them over right away!"

"I doubt it. Are your friends from space? Are they Colored?"

"Ugh...Wait, 'Colored'? Are you seriously that unsubtle about race?"

"Missy, in Toholon, being a different race means you could be a 7-foot-tall lizardman who can bite a mans face off in one chomp. Racial sensitivity isn't terribly high."

Kaijo steps between the two of you. "Don't get flustered people. G-Force is offering to handle more of the people from the new lands, since we've got one already. To take them off your departments hands, Jin, so you can concentrate on the bigger picture. Please, Jin, it'll benefit both of our groups."

"After the mess you made of the Varan incident, I'm not going to hand everything over to you second-tier layabouts. But our resources are stretched...you get one. You can either take the woman from the space capsule, or the colored male who washed up in the mechanical giant. Or one of their machines. We keep the rest."

WILL KATINA TAKE ANY OF THESE OPTIONS, OR WILL SHE ASK SOMETHING ELSE?

Claims to work for some kind of company, was scouting our island when his mechanical giant was attacked by bugs."

"Bugs?"

"G-Force should have a file on them. We can send you one to autopsy if you like, but we know you don't have a proper biologist yet. Seems like an oversight if you ask me."

Kaijo smirks. "Jin, you know better than anyone that half the biologists on the island work for that bastard Gasha behind the scenes."

"Agent Jin, I wish you could be more trusting of G-Force. Cooperation between our two departments can only be beneficial."

"Sorry, trust is at a premium in my line of work. Just make sure you get something useful from all this 'cooperation', then we'll see if G-Force really is worth the scraps the High Intellect throws at it."

You run past and look the new arrival up and down. "Dammit, I don't recognise you at all...Tell me you're from a sane world, with proper giant robots and food made out of pork scratchings and pig dung extract."

The woman looks behind her as the Limo Raider drives away. "I'm sorry, but I'm still trying to take all of this in...I'm Akane Ardygun, I'm a Trailer...You know what a Trailer is, right?"

"Ugh....Something rednecks live in?"

The young woman sighs.

"It's the same all over, Akane. Chill out, we're at least 50% less likely to molest you than those other guys. Thats a start, right?"

"W-w-w-well....It's not every d-day...you get a message from beyond..."

"You got a message? SWEET!! What is it, tell me tell me!!!"

Zondark, hands shaking, turns to a gramaphone-like thing connected by glass tubes and lenses to one of his telescopes, which is peering into the gubbins of your earpiece. "Words...from the planes beyond...And the worst thing is...they're legible..."

He flips a switch. Your heart leaps as a familiar voice cuts through the quiet of the lab.

Katina, destroy the earpiece. They'll use it to track you. You can't find me with it, you'll need a multidimensional computer, than can upload or download between the realms. There should be several, they adjusted the Shards to make sure they had a way. Use that against them, use it to find me, before they figure out what they are.

Kuso = JPN equiv. "Damn" or "Shit."
WARE KOSO WA = Archaic and samurai-esque way of saying "My name is," e.g. "Ware koso wa Baran Doban" - "I am Baran Doban."
Thus, "WARE KUSO WA ___" = Traditionalist way of stating your name while proclaiming that you are (insert preferred profanity here).

Wait, They WERE caught in a timeloop or they ARE? Are you talking about the time between the actual Severing, and them being stitched into the new world, or are they still Groundhogging even after the New World gets fixed up?

If its just the former, that while waiting for the Stitching they were in Groundhog Day Mode, thats fine. My basic idea was that between the shards being ripped out of the dying universes and stayed in a sort of quantum flux, which would have been different for each one. Some would have experienced no time in the void, some years, and potentially some could have been retconned into other shards or the like.

He's got a point. As of late, every thread has been about 30% quest, 40-50% speculation, and about 20-30% unrelated ramblings. It'd be ideal if we could reach a balance like the /m/erotica threads, where we can keep a steady rhythm of bumps just to keep it from dropping off the board. We have 15 pages now, they're not going to fade anytime soon, especially with how slow we move compared to other boards.

"Katina!!!"

You grunt as you're rudely jostled. You absentmindedly reach around, knocking over the three empty Sake pots. You think Nozumi and you were about even on those. It's the extra bottle of Sienan Vodka that did for you.

"Katina!! There's something outside! Something big!! We've gotta go!!" It's that new girl, Acorn or something.

"Riiigh', righ', ah'll fix't." You stumble up to a standing position as only someone entirely inebriated can do, and fall-run to the stairs. You clamber up the steps of the bar and onto the street, and see something large and black on the next street over, standing out in the darkness mainly by dint of not looking real at all.

"Fuck, this movi's got TERRIBLE effects! TERRBILE!"

A roar from a million miles behind you. "It's an Arm Arcus Finis! What is it doing here? And why does it look so odd?"

"D'rector spend the CGI bujjit on coke'n'whores, 's'my guess. Oh wait, this isn't a movie..."

Nozumi, equally as drunk as you, is chasing after the thing, screaming and waving his harpoon wildly in the air.

The unreal mech doesn't seem to be doing much, its just walking down the street. Of course, its steps cause buildings to shake and windows to crack, so apparently it weighs something.

You run along the street, with Akane right behind you, chasing the mech and the mad elf. The Arcus easily outpaces you all, plodding through the streets of Edo, smashing windows and popping street lights, but little else. It occasionally sends light from its eyes into larger buildings, apparently scanning them for something. Sirens blare across the city, and what few people were on the streets make for cover. The city seems to have a good number of shelters and secure structures to take cover in.

The things walks on, up to G-Force HQ. Its scan-beams pass over it, and linger a while longer than the other buildings, but then it walks over, knocking over several walls as it goes. You reach the HQ a minute later, overtaking an out-of-breath Nozumi.

A large man wearing at least 3 belts of grenades leads the G-Force Security Team to secure the grounds. "Ready all explosives! If it comes back this way, fire everything! And if you die, curse those cheapskates in the army for not giving you bigger guns!"

You ignore the lightly armed guards and head over to the R-Blade, which is now standing in the yard. Saotome hops down from the cockpit. "I've gotten it warmed up for you. Sure you're fit to fly it?"

"'m too drunk to answers that kestion wi'out bias."

"...I'm sure you'll do fine."

The R-Blade boots up, and turns to face the black mech, which is headed to the city centre, and the few skyscrapers in this old-timey city. Your radar registers planes and tanks coming from the north.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

Yes.

But I'm sure we can finish this fight while inebriated and autosaging.

And first things first - Ask Akane if we should make radio contact.

Considering we were running around with a earbud that Dumi's enemies were tracking for at least a day?

I'm pretty sure it's after us.

No, it's testosterone-based. So we're fucked if it's actually a Mimetic Beast.

That said, it sounds like this thing's made out of CGI. A virtual object manifested into reality?
