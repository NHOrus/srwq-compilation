##SRWQ2 Mission 1: All by myse-ee-eeelff

###A quick recap for the uninitiated:

This is a Quest Thread, a choose-your-own-adventure type dealie where I provide a setting and plot, and you the audience determine the major actions of the protagonist. Said protagonist in this case is the Katina Tarask of the Shadow Mirror universe, here reinterpreted as a dress-wearing psychopath, her mind damaged by the attempts of the School to control her limitless rage and high combat skill.

Upon her release from the School, our adventure showed her joining the Shadow Mirrors, just before they were scheduled to jump to the OG universe. However, this jump was curtailed when the OG Numbers jumped to their world instead. They claimed they had to change the SMverses timeline to prevent the Zweizergain leading Dark Brain, the interdimensional tyrant, to their world and destroying it.

A mad race began across the SM Earth, in order to find the Zweizergain and regain enough battle strength to rebuild the Shadow Mirror. Along the way, Katina befriended a helpful AI called Dumi, who supported her and helped her overcome some of her issues. Eventually Dumi revealed he was Duminass 7, a servant of Dark Brain, and that he wanted freedom from his dark master in order to live a proper life with Katina and his Homonculus children. Together with the OGverse Irregulars, Katina and Dumi came up with a bold plan.

The team would gather the fragments of worlds Dark Brain had destroyed, and use the power of the Zweizergain, XN Giest and the Compatible Kaiser to unite them into a new world. This would achieve several things. Because Dark Brain could not enter a world he'd already destroyed, it would mean Dumi and the Kaiser would be free from his wrath. It would also be a fresh start for Katina and her friends, allowing them to gain breathing space from the clusterfuck on SM Earth and build themselves into a new force that could solve the problems on both worlds, both alien and human.

The plan went almost perfectly. Unfortunately, the team got a little seperated on arrival...

Can our heroine find her friends and put the Plan back on track? Will she survive in a world that was never meant to be? And will we finally get our long-awaited harem? Let's find out as we begin Super Robot Wars Quest, Disc 2!!!

---

The splash of waves.

The hum of cars.

Seagulls.

And someone babbling moontalk into your face.

You open your eyes and see you're sitting in some sort of seaside cafe, overlooking a wide bay. The shoreline is covered in boats of all shapes and sizes, and theres an odd funnel-shaped cloud in the middle of the water.

The last thing you remember was sitting in your R-Blade, looking out of the Eurydices hangar as Dumi completed the fusion of the Shards into the New World.

You turn to the man who's talking to you. He looks like a waiter of some sort, definitely asian.

"Hey, don't gargle in my face when I've just gotten up."

"Oh, a Caladosian. Gomei, but Madam has been sleeping in that seat for...etto...a while, I guess, and hasn't ordered anything. Will madam be making a purchase at all?"

"...I could murder three coffees right now, but I don't have any moon dollars." You hop off the seat and look out onto the street.

The city is rather old-timey, like a gangster movie set in china-town. Asian people walk the streets in 1920s clothes, old-style cars drive by, some spewing steam, others petrol fumes. Nearby, a man in a labcoat looks into an odd telescope, while up the road, a pointy-eared man and some kind of man-shaped crocodile are having an argument.

WHAT WILL OUR HEROINE DO??

So, where the hell are we? Perhaps we should search out a source of information to get our bearings?

Perhaps ask the waiter where we are, very discreetly. As if the name of the town has slipped our mind for a second...

Most of all, act like nothing is out of the ordinary. We have seen wierder things, after all.

You jog over to the small corwd which is forming about the two. You can't really tell what the crowd is muttering, sounds like Japanese, but the general mood seems to be curiousity and distrust.

Ears is dressed in one of those velvety floral-pattern costumes that girls wear in kung fu movies, but is definitely male. You can't really determine whether he's asian or caucasian, the odd shape of his face, the ears, and the catlike eyes are too distracting. Croc isn't quite as monstrous as he looked from a distance. He's dressed in what you would consider casual clothes, a shirt and loose pants, and sandals over clawed feet. If it weren't for the elongated snout and the green scales, you'd think he was your average blue-collar dude on a break.

The two are hissing and growling away in what sounds like a language that SUVs would have if they could talk. Ears seems to be having no problems talking to his pal, despite this lack of a forked tongue.

The Lizardman doesn't seem to notice your stare, as most of the crowd are doing much the same. Frankly, you probably don't stand out that much: Your dress isn't that wierd next to the women, and he probably can't tell that your complexion is that much different.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

"Excuse me, you in the Mob Moll uniform! What's going on?"

"Moonmoon moonmon nom moon?"

"Er...someone who speaks English? Anyone? Shit, you'd think with so much dealing with Izu the School would have done a better job teaching me Japanese"

A good chunk of the street have turned from staring at the lizardman to staring at you. So is Mr Ears, who then speaks.

"Can I help you, Miss?"

"Uh, yeah...What's up with you and Mr. Scales over there?" The Lizardman grits its teeth as you point at it.

The G-Force building is large for a single three-storey building, but the overall complex is fairly tightly contained, barely enough room for the HQ, the similarly sized hangar, and the Decorative Fountain which looks brand new.

"Cosy, isn't it?"

Zondark nods. "Er, yes, that's one word for it. The building is government surplus, used to be used for building Taxation Computators, we've heavily renovat-"

"SON OF A BITCH!!"

Zondark watches you race off into the hangar.

"That's my fucking R-Blade!! Don't you cavemen so much as look at it funny! I need to to kick peoples asses with."

Three old men in labcoats look around from where they're standing on the R-Blades hull. A middle-aged man in a very crisp suit looks around, scribbling into a notepad without looking. In the corner, someone who looks like a well-armed hobo looks up as if woken from a bad dream.

"It's covered in fucking seaweed! Did you assholes drop it in the ocean or something?"

"Calm down, madam, everything is perfectly under control. We were just investigating our find. Rest assured, we won't damage it."

The man in the...no, the SEX GOD in the white tuxedo shines a mile-wide smile at you. You feel your knees go weak unconsciously.

"Er, um, I...Its just that its all I've got right now..."

"Don't worry madam, we'll keep you Arblade in tip-top shape. G-Forces' Science Corps contains some of the best scientists on Edo, they'll keep it together, and fix up the damage it recieved."

The older man in the crisp, non-brilliant-white suit is now chatting with Zondark in whispered moontongue. He looks at you, then scribbles some more into the notepad.

The three scientists hop down off the mech. They have very appreciative looks on their faces.

The man in the white tux continues grinning, like its how the face naturally goes. "By all means!"

"First, I'll be helping out with the repairs. It's complex technology, and I need to make sure its still fighting fit after."

"Alright, I'm sure the Three Professors won't mind the aid."

"...And I'll want your autograph."

The grin droops a little, but he takes your proffered notebook, still virtually unused, and signs it, 'Kaijo Maki'.

You manage to suppress the urge to squee.

"Th-thanks, I'm Katina Tarask. Pleased to make your acquaintance...And the rest of you are?"

The man in the Crisp Suit comes forward. "I'm Diego Mireniamu, I'm the director of G-Force. The gentleman behind me-" He indicates the barefoot man idly playing with a massive black magnum. "-Is Yume, no known last name. Professors Kabuto, Morimori and Saotome are our scientific corps. You've met Maki, the other members of Team 2 are...about somewhere. Or at the least, close enough that we'll be able to track them from the fires. And you, Miss Tarask...You're from another world, or so mr Zondark says."

He says this in a rather matter-of-fact way, as if the concept doesn't bother him as much as it should. He seems poised over his notepad, ready to scribble as soon as you talk.

...Well fuck, I wasn't expecting that to come up.

I was kinda going with the idea that if there were any Japanese fantasy races about, the rise of the Intellects and humanity's rapid development would have made them extinct real quick. Also, I never cared for most Japanese monsters other than the tengu, the intent was to feature the dichotomy between civilised science and savage magic, the fairly civilised monsters of the japanese mythos wouldnt have gotten that across as well.

We've got to find Dumi, after all. That's our first priority. Although, if we could perhaps use these people to search for him, that would work out. Like, extradimensional scannings and whatnot. I'm sure Dumi gives off some funky transdimensional signatures.

THE STORY SO FAR (from the previous page of threads): Katina Tarask, frilly dress-clad School dropout, has found herself in a series of increasingly inexplicable pickles following the Irregulars of the Super Robot Wars: Original Generations universe invading the Shadow Mirror world right as the Shadow Mirrors were about to invade OG no sekai. So far she's gotten herself locked in a Tausendfussler's bathroom, gotten ejected from said bathroom by her motorcycle-transforming Dynamic General Guardian companion (who also happens to be this world's Duminass), put the fear of God in clairvoyant EFA ace Shine Hausen, gotten piss drunk at Mardi Gras in Brazil, taught Jonathan Kazahara how to love again (at least his work), tangled with Einst-augmented Gespensts on two occasions in Africa, sacked an EFA jamming satellite, wrecked the ODE System and the Neviim in a single confrontation, brokered a half-assed truce with the Balmar following wrecking said Neviim, and half-liquified a Choukijin or two to get at the Einst that were eating them alive anyway.

Katina Tarask, frilly-dress-clad psychopath of the Shadow Mirrors, has found herself at the forefront of the clusterfuck that the SRW: Original Generations cast has uncorked in their paradoxical incursion on her world. With Vindel Mauser's forces on the cusp of self-destruction at the hands of tainted empathic technology and longtime partner Dumi(nass 7) looking for freedom from multiversal terror Dark Brain, Katina finds herself faced with only one way to guarantee the safety of all Super Robot Wars worlds: make her own.
