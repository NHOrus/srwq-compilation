(Yes, the original Godhand edit is woefully out of date, but I don't have the
time to make a new one myself)

A quick recap for the uninitiated:

This is a Quest Thread, a choose-your-own-adventure type dealie where I provide
a setting and plot, and you the audience determine the major actions of the
protagonist. Said protagonist in this case is the Katina Tarask of the Shadow
Mirror universe, here reinterpreted as a dress-wearing psychopath, her mind
damaged by the attempts of the School to control her limitless rage and high
combat skill.

Upon her release from the School, our adventure showed her joining the Shadow
Mirrors, just before they were scheduled to jump to the OG universe. However,
this jump was curtailed when the OG Numbers jumped to their world instead. They
claimed they had to change the SMverses timeline to prevent the Zweizergain
leading Dark Brain, the interdimensional tyrant, to their world and destroying
it.

A mad race began across the SM Earth, in order to find the Zweizergain and
regain enough battle strength to rebuild the Shadow Mirror. Along the way,
Katina befriended a helpful AI called Dumi, who supported her and helped her
overcome some of her issues. Eventually Dumi revealed he was Duminass 7, a
servant of Dark Brain, and that he wanted freedom from his dark master in order
to live a proper life with Katina and his Homonculus children. Together with
the OGverse Irregulars, Katina and Dumi came up with a bold plan.

Quoted By: _>_>_4_7_4_0_6_8_5
The team would gather the fragments of worlds Dark Brain had destroyed, and use
the power of the Zweizergain, XN Giest and the Compatible Kaiser to unite them
into a new world. This would achieve several things. Because Dark Brain could
not enter a world he'd already destroyed, it would mean Dumi and the Kaiser
would be free from his wrath. It would also be a fresh start for Katina and her
friends, allowing them to gain breathing space from the clusterfuck on SM Earth
and build themselves into a new force that could solve the problems on both
worlds, both alien and human.

The plan went almost perfectly. Unfortunately, the team got a little seperated
on arrival...

Can our heroine find her friends and put the Plan back on track? Will she
survive in a world that was never meant to be? And will we finally get our
long-awaited harem? Let's find out as we begin Super Robot Wars Quest, Disc
2!!!

The splash of waves.

The hum of cars.

Seagulls.

And someone babbling moontalk into your face.

You open your eyes and see you're sitting in some sort of seaside cafe,
overlooking a wide bay. The shoreline is covered in boats of all shapes and
sizes, and theres an odd funnel-shaped cloud in the middle of the water.

The last thing you remember was sitting in your R-Blade, looking out of the
Eurydices hangar as Dumi completed the fusion of the Shards into the New World.

You turn to the man who's talking to you. He looks like a waiter of some sort,
definitely asian.

"Hey, don't gargle in my face when I've just gotten up."

"Oh, a Caladosian. Gomei, but Madam has been sleeping in that seat
for...etto...a while, I guess, and hasn't ordered anything. Will madam be
making a purchase at all?"

"...I could murder three coffees right now, but I don't have any moon dollars."
You hop off the seat and look out onto the street.

The city is rather old-timey, like a gangster movie set in china-town. Asian
people walk the streets in 1920s clothes, old-style cars drive by, some spewing
steam, others petrol fumes. Nearby, a man in a labcoat looks into an odd
telescope, while up the road, a pointy-eared man and some kind of man-shaped
crocodile are having an argument.

WHAT WILL OUR HEROINE DO??

So, where the hell are we? Perhaps we should search out a source of information
to get our bearings?

Perhaps ask the waiter where we are, very discreetly. As if the name of the
town has slipped our mind for a second...

Most of all, act like nothing is out of the ordinary. We have seen wierder
things, after all.

You jog over to the small corwd which is forming about the two. You can't
really tell what the crowd is muttering, sounds like Japanese, but the general
mood seems to be curiousity and distrust.

Ears is dressed in one of those velvety floral-pattern costumes that girls wear
in kung fu movies, but is definitely male. You can't really determine whether
he's asian or caucasian, the odd shape of his face, the ears, and the catlike
eyes are too distracting. Croc isn't quite as monstrous as he looked from a
distance. He's dressed in what you would consider casual clothes, a shirt and
loose pants, and sandals over clawed feet. If it weren't for the elongated
snout and the green scales, you'd think he was your average blue-collar dude on
a break.

The two are hissing and growling away in what sounds like a language that SUVs
would have if they could talk. Ears seems to be having no problems talking to
his pal, despite this lack of a forked tongue.

The Lizardman doesn't seem to notice your stare, as most of the crowd are doing
much the same. Frankly, you probably don't stand out that much: Your dress
isn't that wierd next to the women, and he probably can't tell that your
complexion is that much different.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

"Eh...It's kinda like that, yeah..."

"Well then, I'm really not qualified to deal with you. You need to talk to one
of the Intellects of the island, they call them 'Chisei' here."

"Intellects, huh? A smart person does sound like an idea right about now. Where
can I get me one of these?"

"Well, there's one down the street, in the traditional White Coat. He should be
able to help you. Now, if you'll excuse me..."

The elf grunts at the lizardwoman again, and they start walking up the street.
You look back down at the man, still messing with his telescope, practically in
the middle of the sidewalk.

ANY OBJECTIONS TO TALKING TO THIS MAN?

"Yo, science dude, watcha doin'?"

The young man leaps away from you as if you'd just set him on fire. He spends
several seconds flapping his arms to regain his balance, then composes himself.

"H-h-h-hai! Ehhh...Hello, ca-can I help y-you?"

"Yeah, I've been told to talk to an Intelligibleect, and your fancy labcoat
makes you a prime suspect."

"M-me!! I-I-I'm only an apprentice! I mean, I have papers and the like, but I'm
not fully qualified yet. Wh-wh-what did you need me for? I'm q-quite busy,
gravitational phenomon are my Speciality and there have been a lot since the S-
severing."

Most people who meet you have a tendency to stare at your eyes. This poor guy
is more distracted by the bodice of your dress, which even you have to admit is
relatively modest.

You fold your arms up into 'puppy-push' position, and try to put on your

"Now now, Mr Internalect, I'm just looking for a smart guy like you to tell me
a few things. I'm sure you'll be able to meet my needs quite well..."

"...Huh? What? When? Eh, erm...what was the question?"

"I just wanted to know whats been going on, you know, with this Severing, and
the wierd cloud, and the way I woke up in a cafe down the road without know how
I got there."

"....Oh, er, right. Well, there are a lot of chichiImeantheories going about as
to what exactly happened, many by intellects far more senior that me-"

"I want to hear your side of the story."

"....H-hai. Well, judging from the readings I'm seen on my instruments, in my

damage as we originally predicted, but instead damaged the fabric of space-time

"I get it. Go on."

"Yes yes yes, your world got buttfucked and a piece of it got torn away. But

"Uugh..."

"I DIDN'T MEAN TO LOOK! I JUST SAW THE SQUAMOUS DEPTHS!"

"Make some fucking sense goddammit!!"

"MAVE MERCY ON MY FRAGILE MIND! IT'S HALF-BROKEN ALREADY!!"

The punch sends the frantic scientist sprawling. He flails on the ground for a
while, then flails as he gets up, then bows deeply to you.

"My apologies, madam, I have a tendency to get a little flustered when I think
about...those things. But you've given me a moment of clarity...and a broken
nose."

"Are you going to start making sense now?"

"Y-Yes, I probably should...You'd best come back with me to the base, Mr

Still ignoring his nosebleed, the young man sweeps his telescope into its

Also she's wearing the same frilly orange-sherbet dress from the last 45

Which means a wardrobe overhaul is in order. Make sure we allocate for
petticoat-concealed arms, strange growths (tentacles, etc.), and whatnot. Also
a purse with an underslung grenade launcher.

I'm in agreement with Haken. A change of clothes would be appropriate about

Oh. We better stock up on some spares then. With luck at least one of these

I think Katina should at least try and keep some sort of low profile until she

Probably in a communal shipboard laundrette/laundromat. Thus creeping the fuck

Exactly.

This is part of why I've yet to write the "Director's Cut" of the Katina/Arado
scene from Ep1-40: can't properly end the thing.

There's like, a minute or so of afterglow allotted, then the pillow talk turns
Dead Fucking Serious (much like Arado) and goes right back to full-speed plot.

Thinking more on this, I can just see Irm and someone else (Kai maybe? not
sure) trying to get her to leave. Possibly with applied OG Arado.
"But he'll be terrified of what she'll do to him."
"You say that as if he isn't already and frankly she's got it in for him either
way so we're not really losing anything..."

... or something.

...SM!Latooni or SM!Arado walks in, asks "Excuse me WTF are you doin", Katina
tells 'em, they ask if she really couldn't find a more sensible way to wait for
her laundry to get done.

And then quickie on top of the washing machine.

I believe the correct term here, my good sir, is 'Fund it'.

Though i admit when i first thought of it i was thinking more humor than epic
sexings, and with this mindset your suggestion has evolved in my head into an
epic orgy as Irm keeps trying to send someone in to get them out - and they
just end up getting off instead.

And making me an identity because it's probably easier than hoping people
realize which shit i wrote earlier.

It wouldn't be THAT public. Maybe just a couple unnamed crew going "Man, them

The G-Force building is large for a single three-storey building, but the
overall complex is fairly tightly contained, barely enough room for the HQ, the
similarly sized hangar, and the Decorative Fountain which looks brand new.

"Cosy, isn't it?"

Zondark nods. "Er, yes, that's one word for it. The building is government
surplus, used to be used for building Taxation Computators, we've heavily
renovat-"

"SON OF A BITCH!!"

Zondark watches you race off into the hangar.

"That's my fucking R-Blade!! Don't you cavemen so much as look at it funny! I
need to to kick peoples asses with."

Three old men in labcoats look around from where they're standing on the R-
Blades hull. A middle-aged man in a very crisp suit looks around, scribbling
into a notepad without looking. In the corner, someone who looks like a well-
armed hobo looks up as if woken from a bad dream.

"It's covered in fucking seaweed! Did you assholes drop it in the ocean or
something?"

"Calm down, madam, everything is perfectly under control. We were just
investigating our find. Rest assured, we won't damage it."

The man in the...no, the SEX GOD in the white tuxedo shines a mile-wide smile
at you. You feel your knees go weak unconsciously.

"Er, um, I...Its just that its all I've got right now..."

"Don't worry madam, we'll keep you Arblade in tip-top shape. G-Forces' Science
Corps contains some of the best scientists on Edo, they'll keep it together,
and fix up the damage it recieved."

The older man in the crisp, non-brilliant-white suit is now chatting with
Zondark in whispered moontongue. He looks at you, then scribbles some more into
the notepad.

The three scientists hop down off the mech. They have very appreciative looks
on their faces.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO NOW?

These plus introductions sound like a good plan.


In other news, this means that it was not very far form us which goes and
satisfies a worry of mine. To a point. Said worry being that if we were
seperated from our mech, people in the rest of the ship were probably split
form each other... And if Seolla ended up somewhere alone, you KNOW it would
just lead to drama.

"Uh, y-yeah...You can fix it up, on a couple of conditions."

The man in the white tux continues grinning, like its how the face naturally
goes. "By all means!"

"First, I'll be helping out with the repairs. It's complex technology, and I
need to make sure its still fighting fit after."

"Alright, I'm sure the Three Professors won't mind the aid."

"...And I'll want your autograph."

The grin droops a little, but he takes your proffered notebook, still virtually
unused, and signs it, 'Kaijo Maki'.

You manage to suppress the urge to squee.

"Th-thanks, I'm Katina Tarask. Pleased to make your acquaintance...And the rest
of you are?"

The man in the Crisp Suit comes forward. "I'm Diego Mireniamu, I'm the director
of G-Force. The gentleman behind me-" He indicates the barefoot man idly
playing with a massive black magnum. "-Is Yume, no known last name. Professors
Kabuto, Morimori and Saotome are our scientific corps. You've met Maki, the
other members of Team 2 are...about somewhere. Or at the least, close enough
that we'll be able to track them from the fires. And you, Miss Tarask...You're
from another world, or so mr Zondark says."

He says this in a rather matter-of-fact way, as if the concept doesn't bother
him as much as it should. He seems poised over his notepad, ready to scribble
as soon as you talk.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO OR SAY?

Tell them you were on a friends ship, in the R-Blade and then you woke up in

We want to stay away form telling them we made this world, but we should hint
that our arrival here was different form that of most other people.

Is that supposed to make me feel any better about it? Getter has like fifteen
different universes so far, and in every single one of them SHIT GOES DOWN when
you screw with Getter Rays.

Did they put a Photonic Getter Reactor in the R Blade? Oh god, I shudder to
think what would happen if we took the Raioh and it's machine cells with us and
they got crossed with Photon Power and Getter Rays. At least we avoided that
catastrophe, though I wonder what the False Cells will have caused what with
all the war and negative emotions in Shadow Mirror land.

I seriously doubt these guys earned their Super-Science doctorates by putting

Mr Mireniamu turns back to you. "As I was saying, Ms. Tarask, from what contact
we've managed with the new continents in the past few days, it seems everyone
is a similar boat. Their worlds have been struck by disaster and they're lost,
for want of a better term. Cooperation between all parties will be vital in the
days ahead, to understand the situation and to seek a way to undo it. We can't
force anyone to help out, but please, consider working with us to sort out this
mess."

"I dunno, I mean I appreciate you picking up the R-Blade for me, but I sorta
had other plans..."

"I can sweeten the deal. The Tokugawan government has wisely made G-Force's
employment bylaws very flexible. I can put you on the roster as a temporary
member of Team 2, including accomodation and salary of 1000 Nuyen a week. Would
that change things in any way?"

"Depends...That sounds like the kind of deal that has a catch."

"Well, you would be expected to help us deal with G-Class creatures..."

"A who-which?"

"'Any living, non-sentient organism outside the normal realms of zoology,
defined by abnormal size or paranormal abilities, beleived to be of threat to
Tokugawa or her holdings' Or at least, thats the official definition. It tends

I don't know what's scarier, that they still exist in this world or that we
might have to go up against them if we don't want to undo the severing.

...Well fuck, I wasn't expecting that to come up.

I was kinda going with the idea that if there were any Japanese fantasy races
about, the rise of the Intellects and humanity's rapid development would have
made them extinct real quick. Also, I never cared for most Japanese monsters
other than the tengu, the intent was to feature the dichotomy between civilised
science and savage magic, the fairly civilised monsters of the japanese mythos
wouldnt have gotten that across as well.

We've got to find Dumi, after all. That's our first priority. Although, if we
could perhaps use these people to search for him, that would work out. Like,
extradimensional scannings and whatnot. I'm sure Dumi gives off some funky

The big problem with that is that if we are going to be working with them and
getting housing they are going to be expecting us to stay around here for at

While that may help with getting us a support network, most of our allies are
going to be without defenses if they all ended up in different places,

No internet, anime, or wrestling for her to fangirl over.

Anyway, some races are pretty long lived, and could blend in human society,

That's threads 1:30 in a nutshell.
Here's Haken's summary of the rest of Disc 1:

Katina Tarask, frilly-dress-clad psychopath of the Shadow Mirrors, has found
herself at the forefront of the clusterfuck that the SRW: Original Generations
cast has uncorked in their paradoxical incursion on her world. With Vindel
Mauser's forces on the cusp of self-destruction at the hands of tainted
empathic technology and longtime partner Dumi(nass 7) looking for freedom from
multiversal terror Dark Brain, Katina finds herself faced with only one way to
guarantee the safety of all Super Robot Wars worlds: make her own.

Don't forget had sex with Machine-Cell-Zombie Arado. Who may be a Kamen Rider

Fighter Roar and Fighter Emi (Who happen to be Touma and Sleigh)

Currently we are lost in a dimension of our own creation. A dimension of

Sigh...Not everything in the setting even made it across. I'm only featuring
the main human setting and the monsters near to it, stuff like the Russian
Snakemen, the Dwarves that worship Anguiras, and the like have been cut to
streamline the plot into the other Shards.

Besides, don't I provide enough fetish-tastic moments as it is.

Ok, I'll admit, I think there could be a Xaiomu cameo, but not in the way you
think.

Rodan just makes bigass gusts wherever he flies. Mothra might be able to with

Though the first kaiju that comes to mind that could do that is Daghra.

Is that what he looks like? From the pictures I'd seen, I'd assumed he looked
like Blastoise.

Being proof against vacuum does not mean something is watertight. In vacuum
your air is trying to get out, underwater the water is trying to get in,
keeping stuff in is completely different structurally to keeping stuff out.

Nah, more dragon then turtle mostly, though he does have the shoulder cannons.
That's one of Matt Frank's awesome Godzilla Neo redesigns. According to him,
parts of it were manta ray-inspired.

No, but you can take the R-Blade underwater just fine in the OG games. It's
almost certainly watertight.
