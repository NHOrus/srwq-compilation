Welcome, boys and girls, /m/-anons and filthy Tripfags, to the transition point
between the major chapters of SRWQ. Here, we will be discussing possibilities
for the next setting of the game, which fictional elements you the players
would like to see, and how I might horribly remix them into your worst
nightmares...

Coming up: An outline of major issues we'll deal with first. After that, a
discussion on the use of original ideas versus more conventional stuff.

I haven't seen Dancougar Nova ;_;

Hmmm.

Avoiding Evas and RahXephon is a good plan. Evas because tang, RahXephon
because it's not THIS universe that is going to need fixing.

I'm hoping for Gundam ZZ and Victory.
Some Shin Mazinger'd be quite good too.
Maybe some Getter Robo Armageddon.

I suppose Mega Man's out of the question, given Sciencegar doesn't know the
setting.

I also haven't seen Dancougar or Nova. This doesn't nessecarily mean I won't
include, it means I'll likely research them on Wikipedia, watch some of the
more important scenes on youtube, and then change their entire series concept
massively to give myself some form of creative control.

I'm all for a touch of DaiGuard, the heterodyne enemies in particular would fit
in well with the concept of a patched-together universe - all those bits and
pieces which didn't quite fit and slip out of place now and then. Like they are
in the Daigard setting they'd more or less end up as just a different form of
natural disaster.

Ok, so, some of the major concepts we'd need to deal with.

What type of scenario are we aiming for? At times its seemed that the audience
is looking for a more human-scale adventure, with Toku action and EF-style RPG
combat. But as the whole point of coming here is that we can develop new mechs,
going fully human-scale seems counter-productive. I would totally be in favor
of a mix of the two types of action, though.

What kind of world have the Shards formed into? And by this, I mean physically:
Is it an earth-like planet, an infinite flat plane, a Halo or Ringworld, a
Dyson Sphere, what?

Do we want an overarching theme to this world, or should each Shard tell its
own story? There was talk of the entire world being medieval or fantasy in
outlook, or we could have it as a terrible shattered place that needs
rebuilding. I was more of the thought that each Shard is unique, but the way it
interacts with its neighbours drives our plot.

I'm sure there are other issues to go over. Discuss away!

This again ties into the shape of the new universe. If its conventional, with
planets or similar objects in space, then aliens and whatnot are ok. If it's a
totally artificial world with no space, an infinite plane with sunlight
replaced by wierd mini-suns which go on and off at random, then series that
involve spacefleets and which never see Earth are kinda stuck.

Not to say that all the Shards are pieces of Earth, of course.

And I should point out, if you're just asking because you want LoGH....I will
get that wrong, I just know I will. It might be best just to leave it aside.

I think, at first, there should be some level of rebuilding - there's a lot of
stuff crashing together here, it's inevitable that there will be conflict at
first.
We're talking shards of broken realities here, what is exactly in a shard? When
it's added to out world does it just influence things or are the people inside
actively aware that their old reality got fucked up real good?
A lot of the comments seem to be working on the basis that mecha and cast will
just come walking right out into the world almost - i'm not so sure it would be

I'm in agreement. A regular planetary body would be simplest, and each Shard is
its own little world in and of itself.

I'm thinking a shattered world scenario would be good. What I mean by this is,
the world is basically a junkyard formed with the scraps of other worlds.
Important (and not so important) places and people from each world crammed
together into a single world, similar to... SRW...Z...

Actually, I was asking because I thought a planet bound world could be
interesting... One set around the earth and the moon with a bunch of Post-apoc
series kinda like Alpha Gaiden was.

Things like Big O, Gundam X, Getter Robo Armageddon, Zoids, Xanbungle, Gun X
Sword, Trigun...

These two ideas are pretty much what I am thinking. A planet made up of the
important remnants of different worlds, all attempting to pick up what
remaining pieces they still have and move forward.

A singular planet-bound setting would be pretty easy. But i'm dubious about
just slapping shard x to shard y and having each as a distinct entity in our
new universe.
From one standpoint the moment we birthed our reality we created it's entire
history from scratch as well - from the moment of the big bang up until the
now. Logically that means that the contents of the shards must have
intermingled over time. Or maybe i'm just bullshitting since i lost my train of
thought on this already.

So what, everyone from other sources remembers their reality going kaput?

You know, that could be more fun if we weren't necessarily working with the
main casts - it's one thing to have the heroes survive intact but it's another
if it was just their support crews and side-characters instead.

How about Front mission 3?

It has epic storyline and it has plenty of diffrent mechas, not to mention the
Midas can be used quite unexpected ways.
Now that I think about it, Gundam 00 would mesh pretty well with Front
mission...

I nominate Vandread for lulz, there is something hilarous about Women and Men
living on diffrent planets literally...

Throw Gunbuster's world in there, with the events of Gunbuster having lead up
into the Black Hole Bomb which had defeated the STMC, who were actually the
harbingers of Dark Brain.

And then now, after the worlds collided, the plot of Diebuster can take place.
At the end of it, across the interdimensional void and into local space... the
pilots of Buster Machines no. 1 and 2 return.

Have one of the shard fused into the new universe be the one that was

but strands them in space in the new universe.

I did post on the Zeonquest thread about it, but he said he wanted to check
stuff with me before I did anything, which would have involved me making a
sockpuppet IM account just for one conversation. I was considering it, but I
got sidetracked with stuff, and it looks like I'm too late.

Not that it seems to matter, since theres only been one request for a series
where OYW characters would still be viable. Gundam is seriously
underrepresented here for some reason.

That would make quite a bit of sense. Dark Brain is apparently the end-all-be-

I'd say we should have a combination of mecha and on foot. Also, each shard
should be unique, and preferably slightly seperate. Say... layered on top of
each other, shall we say? That is, occupying the same area of space, but
seperate. For instance, if we had both UC Gundam and say, Martain Successor
Nadesico, Nadesico Mars would be different from UC Gundam Mars.

In other words, if one of the worlds has a key feature that if it existed in
others would massively alter their plot, it exists only in its natural setting.
At the same time, if we were in Gun X Sword, the planet that takes place on
would inhabit relatively the same position in the metaverse we're creating as
earth

At the same time, these realities are connected, and travel between them is
possible without the use of dimensional travel technology, because they're
still technically in the same "universe". Characters from one might travel to
one of the others, but mecha would be more complex to transport, due to the
comparative size.

The main reason for doing something like this is to prevent questions like "If
series A (say, Gundam 00) runs off of certain power source (say, GN particles),
why doesn't series B (say, Gundam X) use the same power source (Since GN
particles are rediculously efficient, etc.)?"

Also to explain why if, for instance, we were doing King Gainer, the entire
world would be frozen, while at the same time in Gun X Sword blah blah blah you
get the point.

Uhhh... because in the original Gundam X reality GN particles didn't exist. In
a mashup of 00 and X they would because they resulting reality would be a mix
of both. All of X's tech, having been built before the mashup, would still be
working on principles which existed or didn't exist prior to the mashup.

For another example, having Crossbone Gundam and Nadesico in the same setting.
They have two completely different things going on in Jupiter, which likely
wouldn't mesh together well. There needs to be some level of seperation from
each other to have the plots remotely fit together.

I understand what you are saying, but I honestly would prefer the shattered
world mix... The "If it is better to use X, then why do we use Y" question is
solved in that easily... It simply did not exist in their old universe, and
they have been too busy trying to get by since the merger to go and try to
switch to something new.

Depends entirely which shard this mashup's jupiter came from i would expect.
but given people seem to be favoring the world being a direct mixup, rather
than just all the timelines merged into one coherent whole, would it really
matter what role anything played to anyone in the past?
The only sticky points would be things like Gundam X's satellite cannon -
because there is no garentee that the moonbase would still exist.

Discussion 2: Original content

Couch has been pushing for the inclusion of /m/-original content for a while
now, and I must agree that that could be an interesting spice to add to the mix
of more conventional series we have here.

That said, I must say that I'm not terribly familiar with /m/ original content
other than the most famous. I did see the Project ENIS thing, and while a nice
art project that produced some awesome mech designs, I don't think it had plot
enough for inclusion as much more than a background thing.

Couch provided his own setting, Orbit Exceeder Kerykeion, which I think I'll be
using bits of, but other than that I'm in the dark, with only Kamen Rider Yen
coming to mind. What /m/ originals might you guys like to see in the mix, and
what data can you give me on them?

Also, I have a few ideas of my own to share...

Duh. That's why we rush in to save them, then end up stealing tech from
nadesico stuff ot make some kind of battleship-based energy transfer system so
the X can use it's satellite cannons - albiet to less effect i expect - but as
a bonus we also get to use this tech too.
So there, solving an X problem with Nadesico, which is what i imagine we should
be doing all over in general in order to turn this junkyard of a world into a
coherent place.

And even if it was, I'm fairly certain that the X would survive. It would

survived them then I'm sure Garrod and Tifa would pull through.


My point had been that character's would not be able to rely one some of the

SCIENCEGAR ORIGINAL IDEAS 1: TOHOLON

Imagine Girl Genius crossed with Doc Savage and Godzilla. The Gods created a
standard fantasy world, with elves, dwarves, and those wacky humans going off
to kill Orcs and Snakemen. Then something happened. A human called Prometheus
dared to grasp the power of the gods, and created something incredible.

He created SCIENCE!!! With the capital letters. And the three exclamation
marks.

A thousand years later, the gods are dead and forgotten. The Intellects rule
most of the world, leading the masses of humanity to ever-greater feats of
engineering, well beyond what a 1920s technological base, and a variety of
cliched fantasy kingdoms still in culture shcok, should be able to do. Super-
weapons decide wars, mechs roll out of the factories, and government use plucky
Pulp Heroes (and heroines) to solve their problems.

But in the dark corners of the world, the old forces of Magick have been
stirring, as the older races work to revive their dead gods. And now, titans
walk the earth once more: The Kaiju have arrived, and with their Intellect
stolen to fuel humanities mad endevours, there is nothing left but Divine Power
and Bestial Rage...

Dear sir,

ORIGINAL IDEA 2: THE PSYCHO RANGERS

Across many Shards, there are distant memories of colorful heroes, called the
Sentai, or Power Rangers. Spandex-clad heroes with giant robots, they defended
their worlds from Dark Brain and his servants in many battles. Ultimately,
however, they failed, but because of lack of strength, or failure of their
spirit, but because Dark Brain used their own tricks against them.

Now, wandering the New World bereft of their master, these imperfect Dark
Sentai are all that is left. One from each shard, in different colors, forming
teams as patchwork as the world they helped create through destructions. They
may have been abandoned by their master, but they're still not nice people, if
ever they were people at all.

There are at least 3 full teams active: The Psycho Strikers are the most
powerful, enchanced by a dark force known as the Shadows of Orion. The Psycho
Coverts are the most active however, using their human forms to turn shards to
their dark whims. Meanwhile the Psycho Misfits rampage, their twisted forms an
eternal reminder of the corruption of Dark Brain. A few remain independent,
possibly contemplating a change of heart, or simply having their own dark plans
for the New World.

(TL:DR I don't have time to familiarise myself with all Sentai or even all
Power Rangers, but using Dark Replicas, one for each Sentai series, could work
instead.)

We've got 4 Groups Of Originals to work with
The D
The W
The J
And The K
Sectors would be a good idea, like in K, @G, and Z

There should be a Fury Sector, composed of what Earth would have been like if
Humans had never appeared on Earth and everything went according to the Fury's
plan.
A Standard Future Earth Sector for the W and D people to come from.
A Ruina Sector, which is actually composed of pieces of the home dimension of
Ruina.
An alien world sector would be good, because Earth Q probably wouldn't composed
simply of Earths.

Patlabor can be retooled somewhat to be more a case of all these combat mecha
lying around being repurposed for legitimate non-combat use. This kind of thing
could be led by the patlabor people because, simply, that's their normal view
of mecha to begin with.

I appreciate the lists, it gives me a feel of what people want, but eventually
we'll have to pair it down to managable levels. No rush quite yet though.

I had a few other minor ideas, but they're more things I can slot in as I need
them. If the secondary characters in fantasy Shards seem oddly well-
characterised, its because they're old D&D characters from when I used to DM
for packs of crazy players.

Well this might work as one of the shards. Just remember just not to stick with
western fantasy, but eastern too. (Pulp heroe sversion of Reiji and Xiaomu
anyone? Xiaomu being a Kitsune is probably optional.)

Will there be shards that aren't giant-mecha based as well, as it would seem
contrived that all the shards are picked from worlds that had giant robots?

Err, speaking of original content, of the proposed ideas, has there been any
real, you know, space faring settings? Like, not just based around a planet,
actual space culture, multiple species, etc?
because I have one in mind but if it's been done maybe I shouldnt bother.

Well, the Endless Frontier only had 5 worlds connected by Cross Gates. In
EXCEED, the merging revealed that a sixth world was included, one inhabited by
the Shura.

Speaking of which, the Shura are notably absent throught the quest. Maybe one
of the shards involve the Shura.

DISCUSSION 3: WE ARE NOT RESTRICTED

This is entirely a fan work, limited only by my willingness to type something.
As a result, we can go beyond the strictures of a normal SRW in a variety of
ways. I'm going to point out 3:

WESTERN STUFF
We can use stuff from western series as we see fit. We're already using Megas,
we could expand on this. (And no, no Robotech versus Macross, that would get
silly)

TOKU
While using Sentai is out (mainly I just like the Psycho Ranger idea more),
good old standby Kamen Rider is up for use, as are /m/s other fave toku, if
people want to see them. (In b4 we attract even more 'not /m/' trolls)

NON-MECHA SHOWS: Beyond cameos and the like, non-mecha shows could be a
potentially lucrative source of ideas. At the very least, the main characters
could make interesting pilots...

I'm just pointing these things out, if you guys want to keep it 'pure', thats
fine too.

There was mention of the mysterious scientist, Dr. Folka Albark, who created
the Earthgain series, but you never followed it up.

I am willing to put Banpresto Originals into the New World, but suggestions so
far, for D, W, and K stuff, its a bit beyond me. Gate of Magus only goes so far
for explaining them to me. I'm totally going to play the shit out of J once
they finish translating it, but until then I'm in the dark. I can be persuaded
to introduce Third Interpretations on OG characters we've already seen twice,
but that could just get confusing. I definitely couldn't do a third Katina...

Non-mecha is in?

I have...a CERTAIN idea I'd like to see in action for ground-level play.

Imagine, if you will, a young woman who's finally managed to escape the demons
of her past, only to find that her future is in flux thanks to the gap in
existence her mother left behind when abducted during her childhood. With her
faithful friends and the Wired Train XANALiner at her side, the only thing
standing between her and the truth are hordes of memory-devouring kaijin
scattered across the Shards...and maybe a grave misunderstanding or two with
our heroes.

I could provide an explanation of D guys
It boils down to this
There's Josh who lived the dream (Piloting Test Model for daddy) only to get
disenchanted when Daddy cared more about the Data he got that Josh.
Cliana, composed of two personalities
Liana and Chris, who was Damaged goods when Josh's dad found her, and he
proceeded to run TEST AND EXPERIMENTS ON HER
She came to terms with that, doesn't hate Josh's dad, who's her adopted father.
There's a hit that Josh and Cliana are a little too close but well they're not
REALLY RELATED.

So Yeah, Josh's Dad is a Mad Scientist type of guy.
So he finds some Ruins in Antarctica fucks with them AND OUT COMES RUINA OH
BOY.
Ruina, the Ruina are similar to the ProtoDevlin.
They're from an alternate universe, they feed on on energy produced by humans
(Negative Enery, hate, despair, anger, etc) and there ultimate goal is to build
up enough energy to blow up the Universe.
Ruina is led by Perfectio, the king of ruin, who happens to be hijacking the
body of Josh's dad.
So Ruina basically fucks with everyone to build up energy, blowing up villages,
killing people, etc.
So in the end the Good Guys fight Perfectio, who is unkillable, and was only
defeated by Trieze basically blowing up the gate to Ruina in Antartica and thus
stopping the flow that kept Perfectio unkillable.

Okay, throwing down my suggestions:

World structure: As the Shards were altered in their restitching, they more or
less form a coherent cosmology. There are locations between shards where the
act of forming connections required that they be stretched to fit, resulting in
some shards transitioning smoothly, while others have formed pockets where
natural laws like gravity don't function as they should, and geological
distortions are frequent and violent. Each shard's residents remember the
destruction of their universe, and then a timeless period before it was
restored. It has been anywhere from a few days to a few weeks since the worlds
were joined, meaning interactions between factions are still in formative
stages. As some shards are more fantastic in nature, while others are more
technologically-inclined, initial reactions have been mixed, ranging from fear
to wonder.

The contents I recommend are as follows:

-Super Robot Wars D, J, W, and K Originals (both heroes and villains)
-Orbit Exceeder Kerykeion (provides the center of our real robots)
-Project ENIS (provides the center of our super robots)
-Psycho Sentai Murderanger (provides a villainous sentai faction)
-Toholon (for a bit of fantasy)
-Kamen Rider Yen (mandatory Rider)
-Gunranger (here forming opposition to the Murderangers)

Not to be nasty, but that is not going to happen.

Don't get me wrong, I DO understand where you are coming from, but we already
know that at least SOME of the shards used by Dark Brain come from Other
series. On top of that, you appear to be the only person who wants only
originals.

I think a mix can work as long as we do not have any one thing take a
dominating presence in this new world. That is part of why I have been trying
to cut lists of character form the shows I've been suggesting, or otherwise
trying to figure out ways to fit them in.

For example, having the only part of TTGL that makes it in be Viral, the
Enkidudu, and the human colony he defended. Instead of having all the different
groups and factions form Zoids, almost ALL Zoids would be wild like the ones in
Chaotic Century. The Cast from GaoGaiGar is literally taken from moments after
the kids are returned to earth and are all but wrecked on a strange new world

I'm aware I'm the only one arguing in favor of this, yes. There's a few reasons
for my doing so, but a lot of it boils down to wanting this to be something
new, something different, without being tied down to the stories that came
before and not causing us to rely on the powers other people wrote into being.
It's a personal reason, certainly...but until the decision is made final, I
will argue my point, as anyone who disagrees with me should theirs.

And it's not possible to do something new and different with existing series?
SRW manages to defuse Evangelion in a different way every time. the Nadesico
movie is handled rather differently in W than it is in MX. There's a lot of
room for variation without keeping the same plot. Alpha manages to find
something to do with the UC pilots WELL after their plots are done with.

How about along with a villianous Sentai team (Murdereranger apparently), we
should have the standard Sentai villians as well (Big Boss, Minions, Mooks, and
Monsters of the Week complete with Make My Monster Grow)

However, this Sentai villian group is a total shoutout to the entire medium of
video games. (Which should allow us to use whatever video game characters,
especially ones from none-mecha series that works within reason)

It's a total work in progress, but hopefully it could spawn an idea or two:

Current Big Bad:
Great Demon Boss Bowser (later to be hijacked by Ganon, literally)

Minions:
Machine Boss Eggman
Psycho-Drive Boss Bison
JENOVA Swordman Boss Sephiroth
Zerg Rush Boss Kerrigan

Minions
Fighting Polygons/Wireframes or the Heartless

Monsters of the Week are famous bosses or minions throughout videogamedom.
Haven't thought of a proper monster growing method though.

The opposing Sentai would have been video game themed as well, but I won't
bother with them, since their story would be that the villians were the ones to
exist in their shard.

Non-Originals:
-Cowboy Bebop/Trigun (Both series from a Single Shard. The Crew of the Bebop,
Meryl, Millie and Vash are the only survivors from their Universe. The group is
together as The Bebop had somehow captured Vash and where in transit to earth
to turn him in for a bounty. Meryl and Mille will simply along for the ride.
Both series come from a single shard.)
-GaoGaiGar (Just the members of GGG left behind at the end of FINAL, as stated
earlier. Not Integrated into the worlds unified timeline, still trying to get
their bearings.)
-Godzilla Metaseries (Captain Gordon, The Gotengo, Godzilla, Kiryu, and Mothra.
Space Godzilla is a Spawn of Dark Brain that is cut off form his master in the
new world and works with the Psychorangers.)
-Gurren Lagann (Just Viral and the Enkidudu, no other pilots. He protects a
small settlement of humans who live underground form the many new threats.)
-Transformers: Beast Wars (Grimlock. Was an in Cannon member of the crew who
ditched in Orbit of earth after the Maximals returned to the future and fixed
the timeline. He ends up within a shard after his universe is destroyed by
Unicron, a minion/face of Dark Brain and ends up crashing on the new earth and
taking a New Alt-Mode based of a Gojulas Giga)
-Turn A Gundam/After War Gundam X (Buried Mobile Suits can be found on certain
parts of the globe. The Crew of the Freedan is present, but no one form Turn A
is present. These two series are meant to be treated as from a single shard and
works similar to how things were in Alpha Gaiden.)
-Zoids (Most Zoids are wild Marauding Monsters. Zoids models from ALL series
can be found roaming the planet. Very, VERY few Zoids are piloted. No character
from the Series are present.)

I think that we could probably stick Gun X Sword in somewhere. I want to see
what having Vash and Van in the same universe leads to. The nickname escalation
ALONE would be reason enough for this

Second, the idea with the Crossbone Vanguard (Crossbone Gundam version), Junk
Guild, Serpent Tail, and the W originals forming a small flotilla sounds like
an excellent plan.

Third, I'd support the addition of Godannar, with them being pulled a few days
before Goh is released from the tube in the final episode, so we have a nice
"Countdown until Goh" going on.

4th, Macross 7, only Fire Bomber

5th, Kamen Rider Spirits.

And that's my additions.

I was considering Gun X Sword just for that very fact, but I'm not really sure
how to fit it in... I'm trying to limit just how many character make it over.

On Godannar and Macross 7: I know NOTHING about said shows, so someone else is
going to need to come up with a way to integrate them if we want to try what
I'm purposing... You up to it?

On Spirits: We already have a rider series in this, and I did not want the old
School riders to Overshadow the /m/ Originals.

Well, You have to remember that everything here is fragmented from different
worlds. This isn't like Alpha Gaiden where everything has always been like
this, this is a patchwork world that has only existed for a short time, weeks
or months at most... No where near enough time for Gun X Swords background to
have set in.

While each Shard might have experienced a different length of time between

The Shura are a race of warriors.
They are led by a King, who is strongest fighter among all the Shura.
Strength determines the value of a Shura warrior.
The truly strong Shura pilot machines known as Shura Gods.
Shura Gods are relics from the ancient Shura Ancestors, which are truly
powerful machines.
The nature of Shura society as caused basically destroyed the ability to create
more Shura Gods because the constant fighting has caused valuable information
to be lost.
So only those chosen by a Shura God pilot one, everyone else pilots the mass
produced Shura Mechs, which are probably not even 1/100 as strong as Shura God.
All Shura mechs run on life-force, like the Cybuster, and the Shura Gods select
people strong life forces to pilot them.
The Shura live for Battle, and therefore fight anyone they encounter, in hopes
of finding a new homeland, since they basically do the following
FIND NEW ENEMIES - KILL THEM - LIVE ON THEIR LAND - DESTROY THE LAND THROUGH
CONSTANT FIGHTING - LOOK FOR NEW ENEMIES

the Zoids where wandering monsters already. The Zoids UK comics. And unlike the

an interesting version of the franchise to use...

Less crazy than the orks. The Shura mechs could be compared to Eldar Aspect
Armor, minus the SOULS and attached personalities, with the Shura gods being
equivalent to Exarch armor, and the Apotheosized ones being equivalent to the
Phoenix Lords. Personality more if you took the Ultra Marine's obsession with
the Codex Astartes, then replaced the codex with their own code of laws reading
as mentioned in _>_>_4_7_2_9_1_7_4

Just so you know, there are a couple wikis you can use out there to find Zoid
models if you decide to go with that idea. Most articles give decent
information about how the specific mechs work.

RPG critters from World Broadcasting System and others. Picture a Ghidorah
small enough to stand on a table, that speaks colloquial language, and has
something of a smart-ass personality. 'Refers to a cat eared, post 3rd Impact
Rei as "sensei" for pretty much all the bad reasons you can think of.

Yes.
Further more the Shura are bad about in-fighting.
If Shura do not have an enemy they fight themselves.

The Ultimate Insult in Shura society is to fight an opponent in a Death-Match
and then not kill them.
It's basically saying that the person is so worthless that they're not even
worth killing.

Eventually though, the Shura cycle is broken when Folka is forced to fight his
adopted brother Fernando to the death.
Moments before killing Fernando as befits the victor, Folka's unrest with Shura
society causes him to let Fernando live and abandon the Shura.
Folka then begins to interact with other societies trying to find a way to live
other than the Shura way.
In the end Folka fights Alkaid, king of the Shura, to the death.
Upon victory, Alkaid gives his blessing to Folka and hopes that Folka will lead
the Shura on a better path than he did, naming Folka King of Shura.

If I'm using Ghidorah, it'll be as a big bad for the Toholon section. I don't
need a Twisted Kaiju Theater comedy relief version, I can use the Dorats from

I haven't seen much of Gun X Sword, I'm afraid. But I will say this: Their
world was destroyed. So most likely, you're either looking at the very start of
the series (I think its meant to be post-apocalyptic), or its after an
alternate BAD END.

Wouldn't be hard to drop in, claim the claw man's big plan, when fucked up by
the protagonists, resulted in drawing the attention of dark brain and shit went
downhill from there.

I want this mostly because of El-Dorado and it's crew. Because lets face it,
Katina would get a kick out of old people who kept kicking ass despite being
mostly dead.

Gun X Sword is actually set on a Former Prison Planet that Earth just kind
of... Forgot.

But Yeah... The idea I had was for a Alternate BAD END.

As in clawman activates the Moon. Turns out turning on the moon summons Dark
Brain. Dark Brain Noms the Planet. Van is still alive due to the fact that the
satellite he got stuck in earlier was not shot down. Van ends up being the only
survivor of the Universe because Dark Brain finds his situtation amusing.

The one thing about rule 63 that gets to me is, you never see any female
characters being turned male. It strikes me as an obvious double standard.

...I'm not complaining or anything, its just that I'm touchy about double
standards.

But yeah, I think Fuuko Albark is a given at this stage.

...Will anyone kill me if I make Shura Queen Arucaid an expy of the Tsukihime

Gun X Sword is on the New list I'm working up, as is Godannar and one or two

The Macross 7 stuff is a possibility, but I know less about that than Godannar.

Non-Originals Part 1:
-Big O (Post Season 2; All of Paradigm city made it through the Transfer.
Rodger Smith has been contracted by the City to try and stop the chaos of the
new world everyone has found themselves in. He is a player in World Politics.)
-Cowboy Bebop/Trigun (Both series from a Single Shard. The Crew of the Bebop,
Meryl, Millie and Vash are the only survivors from their Universe. The group is
together as The Bebop had somehow captured Vash and where in transit to earth
to turn him in for a bounty. Meryl and Mille will simply along for the ride.
Both series come from a single shard.)
-GaoGaiGar (Just the members of GGG left behind at the end of FINAL, as stated
earlier. Not Integrated into the worlds unified timeline, still trying to get
their bearings.)
-Godzilla Metaseries (I just re-read Toholon, and came to realize that it was
essentially Fantasy Toho... So Most Kaiju and such are probably going to be in
as is. Still, I think having Captain Gordon, The Gotengo, and Kiryu from a
seperate universe based on Final Wars being pulled into Toholon would be
interested. Oh and I still stand by Spacegodzilla as Dark Brain's servant.)
-Godannar (Still Trying to work this out as I have a very limited knowledge of
the show. One idea is to have them pulled from a universe that was destroyed
shortly before Goh awoke form his sleep at the end of the show. )
-Gun X Sword (Alternate Universe BAD END. Van is unable to stop the Birthday
before the Clawmans plan could be enacted. Instead of it remaking the world in
his image, it summons Dark Brain who devours the entire universe other than the
island the final battle took place. ALTERNATE Possibility: Only Van survives,
due to not getting free of the satellite in orbit during the Activation of the
moon.)

Non-Originals Part 2:
-Gurren Lagann (Just Viral and the Enkidudu, no other pilots. He protects a
small settlement of humans who live underground form the many new threats.)
-Iron Man (Tony Stark, A suit of Armor, and all of Vegas. Need I say More? In
all seriousness, This is Tony Stark from a version of the Marvel Universe where
the Avengers where never formed. Other heroes Existed in his world, but were
unable to band together when the Dark Brain came call with the Annihilation
Wave. Tony managed to defend Las Vegas and now finds himself it's sole
protector in a strange new world.)
-Transformers: Beast Wars (Grimlock. Was an in Cannon member of the crew who
ditched in Orbit of earth after the Maximals returned to the future and fixed
the timeline. He ends up within a shard after his universe is destroyed by
Unicron, a minion/face of Dark Brain and ends up crashing on the new earth and
taking a New Alt-Mode based of a Gojulas Giga)
-Turn A Gundam/After War Gundam X (Buried Mobile Suits can be found on certain
parts of the globe. The Crew of the Freedan is present, but no one form Turn A
is present. These two series are meant to be treated as from a single shard and
works similar to how things were in Alpha Gaiden.)
-Zoids (Most Zoids are wild Marauding Monsters. Zoids models from ALL series
can be found roaming the planet. Very, VERY few Zoids are piloted. No character
from the Series are present.)

are also prospective members of the Flotilla if it happens.)

I'm not as sure about the godzilla stuff (I know very little about it as a
whole) but we don't seem to be hurting for villains and the like - and i'm
really digging the idea of wild zoids around the place, since they give the
remnants of each shard reason to band together to some extent for mutual
protection. Sure a decent mecha is gonna trounce most zoids one on one (or one
on a few with the lower level stuff) but they're not going to be able to do
this 24hours a day 7 days a week - especially the big special units which only
have one viable pilot or limited energy sources.
There must, however, be some kind of hard limit to how many zoids came in on
their shard and there really doesn't seem to be enough time for them to...
uh... shit. Do they self-replicate? get built? I don't recall shit ever really
agreeing on that. Anyway, it leaves some more space which needs filling with
general low level fairly constant threats rather than the big ol' major
villains.

Regarding Goddanar, it wouldn't be hard to use that whole virus/monster thing
it had and mutate it to make us some more lowlevel threats (rather than
hotblood-infecting horror). Hell, wouldn't even need any of the cast if it's
just the monster-maker dingus that's come from it.

Iron Man is easy mode. Scraps, etc
I don't like having BAD END GUN X Sword, cause this, but it does make sense and
cuts down on units (we need his satellite or else he kind dies though,).

The Flotialla needs a colony or two, Van's Satellite and various space assets,
that would be a good space base. Otherwise, I like how you got rid of a lot of
elements yet kept their universe's feels.

LISTEN TO MY SONG!

Basara is a very, very talented asshat. He's a pacifist who flies into warzones
and plays music. This generally leads to awesome, being Macross, where music
has SPECIAL POWERS. He leads the band Fire Bomber. He is also a huge jerk. The
enemies from Macross 7 are some weird energy vampire things called Protodeviln
that drain a person's "Spiritua" and just happen to be weak to music, but it
turns out that they can in fact generate their own Spiritua through music if
they play it themselves and thus no longer have to be evil.

And then Basara goes an plays songs to space whales. I fucking kid you not.

An idea: The Zoids exist and are constantly re-created in the deep wildernesses
of the planet simply in order to provide challenge and strengthen the defenders
of that land. They don't attack 24/7, but about often enough to almost push
someone to the breaking point.

It'd be like the shard itself has taken on an aspect of Vindel's ideology,
improvement through constant battle. Which I think would be cool as it would
reflect ideals that were in the back of most of the main characters heads when
the dimension was created. (Sure we were running away and didn't like them, but
of all the ideals of the various factions in the SM!verse Vindel's stuff would
be the most likely to get reflected in some form, almost subconsciously. That
is aside from all the WARRIOR OF JUSTICE stuff.)

Well, with another example of cross-series tech it wouldn't be hard for him to
*not* have his satellite but is being kept alive, though incapable, from
someone else's tech. 'course that would require some work to bring him back
into being capable of doing anything though.

On Zoids:

Zoids, like transformers are living beings, and By Zoids cannon there are such
a thing known as "Wild Zoids"... I've never really understood how, but they can
evidently reproduce, and yet new models of zoids can be made. Essentially they
reproduce the same way transformers do... and Neither group is telling.

Dude, its simple really. Zoids are actually METALIC life forms. You know the
crests on the zoidan's heads? The fancy red marks? Those are living metal
pieces. Essentally every native zodian is bio-metal (metal in symboisis with
organic material). The human who landed from Earh found that the metal could be
made and turned into zoids of newer make and models. Wild Zoids are simply the
native zoids that evolved. Newer zoids are made by Earth/anchient zoidian tech
to be better than the base models.

Zoid cores can be made by research teams, but Dr. D seems to imply that
REPAIRING one is near impossible, unless you have an organoid. Sort of like
sparks... fuck that works too well.

You assume Vash would hang around to shoot rather than run like hell. I mean
shit, knowing him he'd probably find some way to blame the reality-breaking on
himself the guilt-tripping loon.

If I add GRA in, what would you say about it being as a result of a BAD END of

Well, Theres an awful lot of anime and srw in here, but besides the SRW no
games influence...
Maybe some Armored Core would be good, I could see it providing some conflict,
and baddies to fight .
Take for example, AC3: Due to the all the universal dickery, that outside of
the AC world has become totally screwed and unlivable, forcing all the
inhabitants into the vast underground area called Layered. the Controller, the
mysterious and unseen consciouness keeps the world in check by keeping the
major powers, the Corporations quarralling amongst themselves for it's favor,
and scrounging for resources wherever they can, in order to keep any one power
from becoming to powerful, in effect creating a world of constant conflict.And
then there's the Ravens, the mercs and warriors of layered, not really beholden
to anyone, but still under control of the controller.
And then suddenly our group comes in and throw the whole balance out of whack.
The Corporations either want them for their side to use against the others, or
to kill them and take their technology. The Controller sees them as a treat to
the worlds order and wants them destroyed.
It adds a hitherto missing element to the story, bout how they are effecting
the actual societies of the shards.
Also, the whole thing takes on another angle if we assume the Controller isnt
actually just an intelligent supercomputer placed there to keep the people from
over extedning themselves or leaving layered before the surface heals, but some
other malignant force entirely, purposely keeping them in the dark and fighting
for some purpose of it's own...
Plus we could pick up weapons and parts on the cheap.
And it just makes me wonder what a Machine cell evolution would do to an AC,
which is pretty much a Pilot Skill over Mech capability kind of machine...

I really don't know much about Armored Core to tell you the Truth... And
honestly I hadn't really thought about stuff from Video Games since those do
not normally make it into SRW things.

It does sound interesting though... While I cannot do a write up on it, I will
add it to the Prospects.

Once again we are getting REALLY close to hitting Critical Mass on Existing

Original Materials which is why many series only have a couple of survivors.

ah, I wont suggest anymore of those then. I dont know about anyone else, but
personally im a little leery of submitting any of my own original concepts,
because it feels like I would be kinda forcing my own vision on the whole
thing, and it just doesnt feel right, when I could just do a far removed take
on something else. i dunno, just feels weird.

But, I'll try to throw out some more original stuff if we need to even it up.
hmmm...
I dont know if anyone's thought of this already, but what about a Shard
enitrely populated by Free, intellignet version of SRW Mechs?Like, The same
Mechs, But with their own personalities and whatnot.

Thats not the problem.

The problem is that we have a 5-7 /m/ and Sciencegar series that are what the
stories in this setting should be focusing around.

We now have 13 series that I have done integration write-ups for. Most of these
Integration write-ups involve HEAVY Purning of the Cast so that we can focus on
Sciencegars OG stuff but still have fun with some of the classics.

The problem now is that people are wnating more and more to be added, and I'm
getting worried that even If I keep pruning them down, I'm going to be unable
to keep No-OC's to a managable level for Sciencegar to work with.

_>_>_4_7_3_0_1_9_9
Truth be told I'm interested in only Sciencegars Originals and the Kamen Rider
one, but I figure that him using the Originals would give him more flexibility
with the story, so I'm supporting them.
