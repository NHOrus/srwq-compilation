##SRWQ2 Mission 1: All by myse-ee-eeelff

###A quick recap for the uninitiated:

This is a Quest Thread, a choose-your-own-adventure type dealie where I provide a setting and plot, and you the audience determine the major actions of the protagonist. Said protagonist in this case is the Katina Tarask of the Shadow Mirror universe, here reinterpreted as a dress-wearing psychopath, her mind damaged by the attempts of the School to control her limitless rage and high combat skill.

Upon her release from the School, our adventure showed her joining the Shadow Mirrors, just before they were scheduled to jump to the OG universe. However, this jump was curtailed when the OG Numbers jumped to their world instead. They claimed they had to change the SMverses timeline to prevent the Zweizergain leading Dark Brain, the interdimensional tyrant, to their world and destroying it.

A mad race began across the SM Earth, in order to find the Zweizergain and regain enough battle strength to rebuild the Shadow Mirror. Along the way, Katina befriended a helpful AI called Dumi, who supported her and helped her overcome some of her issues. Eventually Dumi revealed he was Duminass 7, a servant of Dark Brain, and that he wanted freedom from his dark master in order to live a proper life with Katina and his Homonculus children. Together with the OGverse Irregulars, Katina and Dumi came up with a bold plan.

The team would gather the fragments of worlds Dark Brain had destroyed, and use the power of the Zweizergain, XN Giest and the Compatible Kaiser to unite them into a new world. This would achieve several things. Because Dark Brain could not enter a world he'd already destroyed, it would mean Dumi and the Kaiser would be free from his wrath. It would also be a fresh start for Katina and her friends, allowing them to gain breathing space from the clusterfuck on SM Earth and build themselves into a new force that could solve the problems on both worlds, both alien and human.

The plan went almost perfectly. Unfortunately, the team got a little seperated on arrival...

Can our heroine find her friends and put the Plan back on track? Will she survive in a world that was never meant to be? And will we finally get our long-awaited harem? Let's find out as we begin Super Robot Wars Quest, Disc 2!!!

---

The splash of waves.

The hum of cars.

Seagulls.

And someone babbling moontalk into your face.

You open your eyes and see you're sitting in some sort of seaside cafe, overlooking a wide bay. The shoreline is covered in boats of all shapes and sizes, and theres an odd funnel-shaped cloud in the middle of the water.

The last thing you remember was sitting in your R-Blade, looking out of the Eurydices hangar as Dumi completed the fusion of the Shards into the New World.

You turn to the man who's talking to you. He looks like a waiter of some sort, definitely asian.

"Hey, don't gargle in my face when I've just gotten up."

"Oh, a Caladosian. Gomei, but Madam has been sleeping in that seat for... etto... a while, I guess, and hasn't ordered anything. Will madam be making a purchase at all?"

"...I could murder three coffees right now, but I don't have any moon dollars." You hop off the seat and look out onto the street.

The city is rather old-timey, like a gangster movie set in china-town. Asian people walk the streets in 1920s clothes, old-style cars drive by, some spewing steam, others petrol fumes. Nearby, a man in a labcoat looks into an odd telescope, while up the road, a pointy-eared man and some kind of man-shaped crocodile are having an argument.

You jog over to the small corwd which is forming about the two. You can't really tell what the crowd is muttering, sounds like Japanese, but the general mood seems to be curiousity and distrust.

Ears is dressed in one of those velvety floral-pattern costumes that girls wear in kung fu movies, but is definitely male. You can't really determine whether he's asian or caucasian, the odd shape of his face, the ears, and the catlike eyes are too distracting. Croc isn't quite as monstrous as he looked from a distance. He's dressed in what you would consider casual clothes, a shirt and loose pants, and sandals over clawed feet. If it weren't for the elongated snout and the green scales, you'd think he was your average blue-collar dude on a break.

The two are hissing and growling away in what sounds like a language that SUVs would have if they could talk. Ears seems to be having no problems talking to his pal, despite this lack of a forked tongue.

The Lizardman doesn't seem to notice your stare, as most of the crowd are doing much the same. Frankly, you probably don't stand out that much: Your dress isn't that wierd next to the women, and he probably can't tell that your complexion is that much different.

"Excuse me, you in the Mob Moll uniform! What's going on?"

"Moonmoon moonmon nom moon?"

"Er... someone who speaks English? Anyone? Shit, you'd think with so much dealing with Izu the School would have done a better job teaching me Japanese"

A good chunk of the street have turned from staring at the lizardman to staring at you. So is Mr Ears, who then speaks.

"Can I help you, Miss?"

"Uh, yeah... What's up with you and Mr. Scales over there?" The Lizardman grits its teeth as you point at it.

"We were discussing some business arrangements, nothing more. Mrs Rathonir is rather eager to leave the city, but, of course, with the ocean so greatly changed, my ship cannot go very far. I am a merchant, not an explorer."

"Oh, right... That's a chick?"

"And what of yourself, madam? You must be quite bewildered by the Severing, and the news of the missing continents. I take you as a Caladosian, you must be concerned about your absent homeland."

"Ugh, yeah... I'm a little more concerned about the fact I just woke up in that cafe down the road, and I'm not sure how."

"Really?" the pointy-eared man pauses to grunt at the lizardwoman some more. She seems agitated that the conversation has turned from her.

"Yeah, I was just... on my friends ship, with my R-Blade, when I sorta... blacked out. Then I just came too there."

"Interesting... Madam, perhaps you should see a doctor, I'm currently quite busy, as you can see..."

"Hey! I'm talking to you! Tell me where I am!"

The elf closes his eyes in annoyance, hisses something at the lizardwoman, and turns back to you. "You're in the harbour district of Edo, capital of Tokugawa Island, in the Crescent Isles, in whats left of the Great Ocean."

"See, was that so hard?"

"Madam, are you a newcomer to these lands? Are you from the new continents?"

"Eh... It's kinda like that, yeah..."

"Well then, I'm really not qualified to deal with you. You need to talk to one of the Intellects of the island, they call them 'Chisei' here."

"Intellects, huh? A smart person does sound like an idea right about now. Where can I get me one of these?"

"Well, there's one down the street, in the traditional White Coat. He should be able to help you. Now, if you'll excuse me..."

The elf grunts at the lizardwoman again, and they start walking up the street. You look back down at the man, still messing with his telescope, practically in the middle of the sidewalk.

---

"Yo, science dude, watcha doin'?"

The young man leaps away from you as if you'd just set him on fire. He spends several seconds flapping his arms to regain his balance, then composes himself.

"H-h-h-hai! Ehhh... Hello, ca-can I help y-you?"

"Yeah, I've been told to talk to an Intelligibleect, and your fancy labcoat makes you a prime suspect."

"M-me!! I-I-I'm only an apprentice! I mean, I have papers and the like, but I'm not fully qualified yet. Wh-wh-what did you need me for? I'm q-quite busy, gravitational phenomon are my Speciality and there have been a lot since the S-severing."

Most people who meet you have a tendency to stare at your eyes. This poor guy is more distracted by the bodice of your dress, which even you have to admit is relatively modest.

You fold your arms up into 'puppy-push' position, and try to put on your moeface. It's pointless really because he ain't looking at your face.

"Now now, Mr Internalect, I'm just looking for a smart guy like you to tell me a few things. I'm sure you'll be able to meet my needs quite well..."

"...Huh? What? When? Eh, erm... what was the question?"

"I just wanted to know whats been going on, you know, with this Severing, and the weird cloud, and the way I woke up in a cafe down the road without know how I got there."

"....Oh, er, right. Well, there are a lot of chichiImeantheories going about as to what exactly happened, many by intellects far more senior that me-"

"I want to hear your side of the story."

"....H-hai. Well, judging from the readings I'm seen on my instruments, in my oppaiImeanopinion, the impact of the Devilite Asteroid didn't cause physical damage as we originally predicted, but instead damaged the fabric of space-time itself. If you don't know what I mean by space-time, its a new theory I'm putting forw-"

"I get it. Go on."

"...Oh... Well, It seems the R asteroid, although we destroyed it physically with our superweapons, had an interdimensional component which cracked spacetime, and lifted the Crescent Isles out of our reality and into a sort of zero-dimensional void. I written an excellent paper on such voids, in my opinions, it's the Journal o-"

"Yes yes yes, your world got buttfucked and a piece of it got torn away. But what happened AFTER that?"

"....What do you mean 'your world'?" The young man is staring at your face now, awkwardness replaced by sheer horror.

"Uugh..."

"WHAT ARE YOU? ARE YOU ONE OF THEM?"

"One of the Who?"

"I DIDN'T MEAN TO LOOK! I JUST SAW THE SQUAMOUS DEPTHS!"

"Make some fucking sense goddammit!!"

"MAVE MERCY ON MY FRAGILE MIND! IT'S HALF-BROKEN ALREADY!!"

The punch sends the frantic scientist sprawling. He flails on the ground for a while, then flails as he gets up, then bows deeply to you.

"My apologies, madam, I have a tendency to get a little flustered when I think about... those things. But you've given me a moment of clarity... and a broken nose."

"Are you going to start making sense now?"

"Y-Yes, I probably should... You'd best come back with me to the base, Mr Mireniamu is probably the best person to talk to."

Still ignoring his nosebleed, the young man sweeps his telescope into its special briefcase in one smooth motion, then hails a passing horse-drawn cab.

"G-Force Headquarters, onegaishimasu."

---

The young man dabs at his nose with a hankerchief and tries not to go goggle-eyed as you fiddle with the lace on the front of your bodice. He doesn't even see your other hand twiddling in your ear.

You're getting nothing but static. You try pressing a few of the tiny buttons, and theres eventually a change in the crackling.

"BHBHSHSHZZHZHRealspace signal #3829 confirmed."

_BZHZatinaBZH_

"Elevated dimensional significance, adding to priority list."

_BZZHHNexBZHHevelBZZ_

"Triangulating intercept within 4300 megacycles."

_BZZHPhotonicBZZatter_

"Prepare to be computedBZZZZHHH"

"Er, miss, I didn't quite catch your name. I'm Furyu Zondark."

You snap out of the reverie. "Zoldark?"

"Zondark. I can understand the confusion though. And you?"

"Er... I'm Katina, Katina Tarask."

"Well, nice to properly meet you, Katina. We'll just pulling up to the HQ now."

The G-Force building is large for a single three-storey building, but the overall complex is fairly tightly contained, barely enough room for the HQ, the similarly sized hangar, and the Decorative Fountain which looks brand new.

"Cosy, isn't it?"

Zondark nods. "Er, yes, that's one word for it. The building is government surplus, used to be used for building Taxation Computators, we've heavily renovat-"

"SON OF A BITCH!!"

Zondark watches you race off into the hangar.

"That's my fucking R-Blade!! Don't you cavemen so much as look at it funny! I need to to kick peoples asses with."

Three old men in labcoats look around from where they're standing on the R-Blades hull. A middle-aged man in a very crisp suit looks around, scribbling into a notepad without looking. In the corner, someone who looks like a well-armed hobo looks up as if woken from a bad dream.

"It's covered in fucking seaweed! Did you assholes drop it in the ocean or something?"

"Calm down, madam, everything is perfectly under control. We were just investigating our find. Rest assured, we won't damage it."

The man in the... no, the SEX GOD in the white tuxedo shines a mile-wide smile at you. You feel your knees go weak unconsciously.

"Er, um, I... It's just that it's all I've got right now..."

"Don't worry madam, we'll keep you Arblade in tip-top shape. G-Forces' Science Corps contains some of the best scientists on Edo, they'll keep it together, and fix up the damage it recieved."

The older man in the crisp, non-brilliant-white suit is now chatting with Zondark in whispered moontongue. He looks at you, then scribbles some more into the notepad.

The three scientists hop down off the mech. They have very appreciative looks on their faces.

"Uh, y-yeah... You can fix it up, on a couple of conditions."

The man in the white tux continues grinning, like its how the face naturally goes. "By all means!"

"First, I'll be helping out with the repairs. It's complex technology, and I need to make sure its still fighting fit after."

"Alright, I'm sure the Three Professors won't mind the aid."

"...And I'll want your autograph."

The grin droops a little, but he takes your proffered notebook, still virtually unused, and signs it, 'Kaijo Maki'.

You manage to suppress the urge to squee.

"Th-thanks, I'm Katina Tarask. Pleased to make your acquaintance... And the rest of you are?"

The man in the Crisp Suit comes forward. "I'm Diego Mireniamu, I'm the director of G-Force. The gentleman behind me-" He indicates the barefoot man idly playing with a massive black magnum. "-Is Yume, no known last name. Professors Kabuto, Morimori and Saotome are our scientific corps. You've met Maki, the other members of Team 2 are... about somewhere. Or at the least, close enough that we'll be able to track them from the fires. And you, Miss Tarask... You're from another world, or so Mr. Zondark says."

He says this in a rather matter-of-fact way, as if the concept doesn't bother him as much as it should. He seems poised over his notepad, ready to scribble as soon as you talk.

"I guess, yeah, I'm from another world. I was just on a friends ship, watching a pretty lightshow, when whumpf, I'm in a cafe down in the harbour district."

*Scribble scribble* "Yes... Could you be a bit more specific on the 'ship'? Do you mean sea ship, land ship, airship, Underground drillship, I suppose given modern technology some kind of star-ship is possible... And what there any unusual technology around at the time? Could one of your intellects have been experimenting on you without your knowledge?"

"I... Uh, I plead the fifth..."

"...I'll assume thats a reference to something or other. Very well, we have our manners here in Edo, we won't pry, but... If we're going to undo whatever this Severing was, we're likely going to have to pool our resources. Luckily, we have Zondark here, a top specialist in stellar and extra-stellar phenomena, and Professor Saotome is studying extradimensional energy-"

"I haven't confirmed that yet! All I know is that the metals I've designed react intelligently to Particle G-Eta, I still haven't confirmed where the particles are coming from. The very fact that out world has moved yet the particles can still be generated implies they're not from an outside source, at least, not a specific one..."

*Scribble scribble* "I see. Keep me posted on any changes."

Mr Mireniamu turns back to you. "As I was saying, Ms. Tarask, from what contact we've managed with the new continents in the past few days, it seems everyone is a similar boat. Their worlds have been struck by disaster and they're lost, for want of a better term. Cooperation between all parties will be vital in the days ahead, to understand the situation and to seek a way to undo it. We can't force anyone to help out, but please, consider working with us to sort out this mess."

"I dunno, I mean I appreciate you picking up the R-Blade for me, but I sorta had other plans..."

"I can sweeten the deal. The Tokugawan government has wisely made G-Force's employment bylaws very flexible. I can put you on the roster as a temporary member of Team 2, including accomodation and salary of 1000 Nuyen a week. Would that change things in any way?"

"Depends...That sounds like the kind of deal that has a catch."

"Well, you would be expected to help us deal with G-Class creatures..."

"A who-which?"

"'Any living, non-sentient organism outside the normal realms of zoology, defined by abnormal size or paranormal abilities, beleived to be of threat to Tokugawa or her holdings' Or at least, thats the official definition. It tends to be applied rather loosely..."

I don't know what's scarier, that they still exist in this world or that we might have to go up against them if we don't want to undo the severing.

You know, seeing as we kind of CAUSED the damn thing so that Dark Brain couldn't get in to this world.

...Well fuck, I wasn't expecting that to come up.

I was kinda going with the idea that if there were any Japanese fantasy races about, the rise of the Intellects and humanity's rapid development would have made them extinct real quick. Also, I never cared for most Japanese monsters other than the tengu, the intent was to feature the dichotomy between civilised science and savage magic, the fairly civilised monsters of the japanese mythos wouldnt have gotten that across as well.

Politely decline.

We've got to find Dumi, after all. That's our first priority. Although, if we could perhaps use these people to search for him, that would work out. Like, extradimensional scannings and whatnot. I'm sure Dumi gives off some funky transdimensional signatures.

The big problem with that is that if we are going to be working with them and getting housing they are going to be expecting us to stay around here for at least some time...

While that may help with getting us a support network, most of our allies are going to be without defenses if they all ended up in different places, espcially Dumi.

Hence why if we join, we join on the condition that they forward any data regarding anomalies such as dimensional distortions or trans-dimensional signals to us, and that us inspecting these to find our friends takes precedence over their work.

Either they meet the condition that our search takes priority, or we take the R Blade and leave. Not that we'd get very far without fuel, but...

Yoinked from Haken's thread archive:

THE STORY SO FAR (from the previous page of threads): Katina Tarask, frilly dress-clad School dropout, has found herself in a series of increasingly inexplicable pickles following the Irregulars of the Super Robot Wars: Original Generations universe invading the Shadow Mirror world right as the Shadow Mirrors were about to invade OG no sekai. So far she's gotten herself locked in a Tausendfussler's bathroom, gotten ejected from said bathroom by her motorcycle-transforming Dynamic General Guardian companion (who also happens to be this world's Duminass), put the fear of God in clairvoyant EFA ace Shine Hausen, gotten piss drunk at Mardi Gras in Brazil, taught Jonathan Kazahara how to love again (at least his work), tangled with Einst-augmented Gespensts on two occasions in Africa, sacked an EFA jamming satellite, wrecked the ODE System and the Neviim in a single confrontation, brokered a half-assed truce with the Balmar following wrecking said Neviim, and half-liquified a Choukijin or two to get at the Einst that were eating them alive anyway.

Can't have an AU Xiaomu without one, if we can have one. Has to be AU anyway. No internet, anime, or wrestling for her to fangirl over.

Anyway, some races are pretty long lived, and could blend in human society, just very very rare. Or as Xiaomu would say:

Here's Haken's summary of the rest of Disc 1:

Katina Tarask, frilly-dress-clad psychopath of the Shadow Mirrors, has found herself at the forefront of the clusterfuck that the SRW: Original Generations cast has uncorked in their paradoxical incursion on her world. With Vindel Mauser's forces on the cusp of self-destruction at the hands of tainted empathic technology and longtime partner Dumi(nass 7) looking for freedom from multiversal terror Dark Brain, Katina finds herself faced with only one way to guarantee the safety of all Super Robot Wars worlds: make her own.

Sigh...Not everything in the setting even made it across. I'm only featuring the main human setting and the monsters near to it, stuff like the Russian Snakemen, the Dwarves that worship Anguiras, and the like have been cut to streamline the plot into the other Shards.

Besides, don't I provide enough fetish-tastic moments as it is.

Yeah, I hate to have to say this as I hate when I'm told to do it myself, but running through the archives is probably your best bet for understanding the madness. I do realise thats a LOT of material to cover, but what can I say? I can pump it out when I get into it [/innuendo].

"Wonderful! I'll just get th-"

"BUT I'll have to insist you help me out with finding my friends as a top priority. I don't want to leave them hanging in this New World, not if its full of wierd monsters and shit. I want to track them all down ASAP."

"As Soon As Possible? Alright then, we'll see what we can do on that part. At the very least, we'll probably have to make a voyage to another continent sooner rather than later. Perhaps this search would give us some insight into whats been happening with all these different lands ending up in one place."

"Yeah...It just might."

POTENTIAL PRIORITIES TO START WITH
Meet your teammates.
Learn the local geography.
Get to know the base and the city around it.
Learn some backstory.
Help fix R-Blade while chatting with scientists.
Ask about the wierd cloud-thing that you saw in the bay.
Other.

Get to know the base and area around it, then look at general geography.
Even with the R-blade, we're still not really equipped for long distance travel here - so we can assume that we may have to hang around for a bit. Might as well scope out important shit like escape routes and tech work looking into late.

Off the top of my head Mothra and Rodan can create such things... Gamera may be able to as well.

Or... Ah SHIT, it might have something to do with the Grail War!

Rodan just makes bigass gusts wherever he flies. Mothra might be able to with some of her freaky goddess-magic, as might Mothra Leo.

Though the first kaiju that comes to mind that could do that is Daghra. Seriously, that's all but his calling card, and he would be a perfect starter kaiju boss fight.

I was under the impression that they were not airtight sue to the fact that you always see pilots in spacesuits when their mecha are in space, but you make a good point.

The pilot suits are partially for protection in case they crash or something, and partially as a second line of 'defence' so to speak in case theres a cockpit breach.

Being proof against vacuum does not mean something is watertight. In vacuum your air is trying to get out, underwater the water is trying to get in, keeping stuff in is completely different structurally to keeping stuff out.

No, but you can take the R-Blade underwater just fine in the OG games. It's almost certainly watertight.
