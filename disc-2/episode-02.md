In our last thread, our Heroine, Katina Tarask, woke up in the city of Edo, capital of one of the lost fragments of the worlds used in Dumi's experiment. She managed to stumble through the city with their wierd mix of japanese and 1920s Chicago culture, and found herself allied with a group known as G-Force. They promised to help her find her lost friends and figure what is going on in this new patchwork world, but in return, she would have to help them keep Edo safe from the giant monsters which threatened them periodically...

You clean the last of the seafloor gunk out of the R-Blades left elbow servo and start rotating it to test. "So it was just lying in the bay?"

Professor Kabuto nods from the head, where he's inspecting the vulcans. His eyepatch is definitely not as sexy as Kais. "Yes, the waves from the Severing unmoored several boats from the harbour, including a monster cocoon we had been preparing to return to its home island. Its barge sank close to the Crack, and the Aderu had to fish it out before it was sucked in. They found your Jinga at the same time, it had apparently just emerged from the Crack."

"The Crack...you mean that wierd glowy cloud thing?"

"Yes, that phenomenon. Some kind of dimensional thing left over from one of the early missions. Broke right open again when the R Asteroid hit, and its been alternately sucking things up and spitting slightly different things out since."

"Wait, so it was there beforehand? How?"

"Funny story, which I'd gotten the details, but the three of us didn't join up with G-Force till about a week after. Basically it was the result of the weapon that got rid of that Gojira thing, the first monster, that made them set up G-Force in the first place."

You look incredulously at the old man as he expertly tunes a weapon that shouldn't exist in this world for 50 years. "You've got guns that can break dimensions?"

"Like I said, not my field. I work on Dual-State Weaponry, combining physical and energy-based weapons for best effect. You're better asking Zondark, he helped make that thing."

The R-Blade is looking almost ship-shape again, although the G-railgun is missing and the G-Revolvers mag-rails have been messed up by the seawater.

TALK TO ZONDARK SPECIFICALLY, OR MEET THE G-FORCE TEAM IN GENERAL?

You put on your best moeface as you run in G-Forces resident dreamy hearthrob. "Hello, Kaijo-san! And how are you?"

Kaijo grins his usual calming grin. "I'm quite well, Ms. Tarask. Mr. Mireniamu was wondering if you could give him the details on those friends of yours you wanted to find."

"Oh there'll be plenty of time for that later! Right now, I should get to know the team! Stoke up the team spirit, and all that!"

"Alright then. Everyone should be in the meeting room." He leads you past the fountain, which still has a factory-fresh smell, and into the main building itself. He waves at the secretary. "Emiko, this is our new team member, Katina Tarask."

The young woman looks over a monstrous of folders at you. "Pleased to meet you. I've organised you a room on the second floor. I hope its not too warm, its next to the Computator Storage..."

Kaijo leads you on to the meeting room. Inside, four people are seated, looking over various maps and blurry pictures of wierd creatures.

"Katina, these are the other members of G-Force Team 2."

The first to stand to shake your hand is a petite girl in chinese-style dress, much like the Elf dude you saw earlier, but here its a lot more fitting. Her ears are slightly pointed, but she seems human enough, with close auburn hair and deep green eyes.

"Hello, Miss-san. I am name Chouko Hotaru. My Caladosian not bad, is it?"

"Eh, it adds to your charm. What do you do around here?"

She giggles slightly. "That is secret. Woman has secrets, ne? Just say, I know the proper peoples."

"Fair enough. And you sir?"

This guy is definitely an elf, but his catlike eyes are bloodshot, and he stinks of cheap gin. He reminds you of Kusuha if she were male, had pointy ears, dressed like a pirate and carried a harpoon with her even when sitting down.

"I'm Nozumi, and don't talk so loud. And look so loud."

"Lightweight. What do you do?"

"I'm mostly here to stab things with my big stabby thing."

"A man after my own heart. Be careful, Kaijo, you've got competition."

Kaijo just looks bemused at this.

"Hold on a moment!" Comes a voice from the other end of the table. "Why are you talking with the smallfolk first, when a Lord is sitting at the table."

The man is tall, but you think an inch or two of it is from his well-made boots, and is in his late 30s. He is dressed in what you can only describe as a samurai business suit, his dress halfway between something from a company meeting and something from a Kurosawa movie. He has a katana at his belt, and a wallet-like business card holder on the other hip.

"Huh, didn't notice. And who might I be speaking to?"

"I am the 1827th Lord Ogomo, President of the Ogomo Zaibatsu and Leader of this team!"

Nozumi frowns. "When did that happen? I thought Kaijo was the leader?"

Chouko giggles. "Kaijo-san is leader is the shadows. Chouko is true leader behind the scenes!"

Ogomo grunts. "You won't be so impudent once I've gotten this facility under my companys wing!"

Kaijo raises an eyebrow. "You're going to buy out a secret government department that answers directly to the High Intellect?"

"Just watch me. My lawyers will have the paperwork filled out in a matter of months."

You step out from between the two men. "Bored now. Who's the guy in the corner eating cake?"

The unshaven man shakes his head, and holds up a notepad and pencil while saying something.

"He says he'll talk to you with drawings."

"...Kay. And whats all this on the table?"

"Mr Mireniamu said we should have a brainstorming session of some sort, to see if theres anything we can occupy ourselves with while we're between missions. I suppose it'd be a good time to get you up to speed, Katina."

WHAT WOULD KATINA LIKE TO TALK ABOUT? Infodumps and/or the creation of plans are appropriate, or we could have more conversation.

Big G himself is between 50 and 100 meters, depending on the Era and he's about the average. Most other "Hero Monsters" tend to be between 30-70 in my experience.
Your big ones, like say King Ghidorah, are more like the 120 to 150 range.
Remember our R-Blade is less than 20.

Showa-era kaiju tended to be around 50m in hieght, about the size of a Grungust, and about 3 times the size of the R-Blade. Heisei Era upped the game about halfway through, and made 100m the standard.

Thats assuming I'm just using the canon kaiju. I could start being original again...

Honestly, it depends on the era its movie was made in. Godzilla himself has grown dramatically over the years, since the original 1954 version would be dwarfed by modern architecture. The Final Wars incarnation was around 100 meters tall, while Kaiser Ghidorah towered over him at 140.

The modern incarnation of Anguirus, who's probably the most "normal" kaiju you could come across, is 90 meters, but he's a quadruped, so I'm not sure if that's head height, shoulder height, or him standing on his rear legs.

Your Showa-era Kaiju were around 50-60 meters, with Ghidorah towering over everyone at 100 meters and Anguirus being 100 meter from nose to tail, thoughhe usually walked on all fours.

Heisei-era kaiju were usually 120 meters tall. Godzilla started at 80 meters and grew to 100 meters and Ghidorah was 140 meters tall.

Most of the Millenium kaiju had Showa proportions; even Ghidorah was only around 50 meters tall.

Final Wars took the kaiju sizes back up to Heisei levels though.

In an attempt to get things back on course somewhat, I present the following ideas to you all. What do you guys think?

Possible R-Blade Upgrades:

Kaiju/Ship Breaker Blade Tonfa's:
Prof. Kabuto said he specializes in Dual-State Weaponry. We should see if it would be possible for him to create a way to get additional Cutting power out of the Blade Tonfa's, possibly by combining some type of “Proto-Beam Saber” tech into the Tonfa's.

Maser Revolvers:
Assuming the G-Revolvers Mag Rails are not fixable, we should see If the Professors are capable of using the remains of said weapons to create Masers sized for the R-Blade.

Enhanced Generator:
Another thing we should look into is whether or not any of the Professors believe there is anything they can do to renovate the R-Blades Generator.

Flight:
I doubt it, but if we get enough Mad Scientists in on it (And if we know enough about them to actually be of any help), we might be able to get them to create a equivalent to a Tesla Drive.

Other possibilities:
Maybe see if we can assist Saotome in testing of some of his G-Eta Particle Devices and the Alloys he has evidently made to work with said particles.

This is the sequel game "We know you had Mazinkaiser, Shin Getter and the SRX at the end of last game but for balance reasons you're bumped back to the starter" part. I don't doubt you'll be getting some form of better mech soon enough...

In the middle of escaping from the sinking landship pretty early on. Citan is every bit the bro I expected him to be, and the gratuitous flashbackery is actually doing more to codify Xenosaga's spoilers rather than this game's.

Mostly accidental. I assigned them to the Hiryu Kai randomly (and put the ATX team on the Kurogane, shows how bad my memory can get for obvious details), then I randomly assigned them the mission to track down Lalia, a plot thread I'd left dangling since the meeting with SM!Ryuune. This kinda put them on a bus for most of the plot.

"In what way, exactly?"

"In firepower, of course!! You can't expect to take on monsters with cute uniforms and a loose recruitment policy. How many PTs you got, air support, carriers, moon rockets. Whatever we got, I want to know."

"Alright...G-Force isn't very long established, only a few months, and its still working out the logistics issues."

Chouko points a finger. "Like the proper base shaped like G?"

"...Yes, I belive that was on the recquisition list. We've put in orders for a lot of stuff, but the lead time is an issue. The Tokugawan defense forces are in the middle of their first major rearmament since the Civil War, so they've been giving out contracts to all the people we need to build stuff for us."

You grimaced. "Shit. I guess thats the problem with government funding..."

"We currently have the main team here, the Science Warship Aderu, our main source of firepower, our transport seaplane, the three scientists and their inventions, Zondarks scopes, our Security Team guarding the base and harbor installation, the Priestesses, and Battra."

"...That's it? Where are your mechs?"

"...Well alright, a lot of G-Forces early success was due to the different makeup back then."

"Different how?"

"...As in completely different. We're called Team 2 for a reason. Team 1 is currently MIA, we're their replacements."

"Oh...What did they have that you didn't?"

"Intellects for one. The infamous Atlantean Renegade Dr. Meiun, and our homegrown hero Akio Nakamura. It was Akio and Zondark that came up with the Black Hole Cannon that stopped Gojira. Afterwards, they said they didn't want to develop the technology. Something about 'a 10-20 percent chance of destroying the planet each time it fired'."

"If Ring were here, she could give them some tips...When you say MIA, where exactly did they go missing?"

"Long story short? Into the Crack."

Battra is indeed sapient, but very temperamental. He has little patience for people's shit, unlike his sister. The fact that they can even count him among their forces is nothing short of a miracle. Using him for airdrops just might offend him a tad.

Also, continue expositing. Everything point we can get in Brave New World Lore is worth it.

"It's a baby Mosura that we recovered from a wealth industrialists collection of rare artefacts, along with the Priestesses. He'd corrupted it with some kind of odd device, and it had grown well beyond its normal size. We managed to free the priestesses and they calmed it down, and made it form a cocoon. We were going to transport it back to Mosura Island, but, well, Mosura Island isn't were it used to be. So the cocoon has been sitting on a barge in the harbour next to the Aderu for the past few days."

"....And a Mosura is?"

"A large moth-like creature, apparently semi-intelligent, something like 10 or 20 meters long. Battra grown much bigger, his cocoon is about 50 meters long."

Uh, Wodan is a W-number as well.

Ok, current status of the various W-ised cast members.

Echidna: Still a doll, although it seems she's been assigned as the Raiohs pilot for some reason. This is an awesome plan that can't possibly backfire.

Wodan: Has been waking up since his initial machine-cell exposure. Remember originally, he wasn't activated until the Shadow Mirrors were in the Earth Cradle and could hook him up directly to the Magus computer. Here he was forcibly activated by SM!Sophia Nate in order to save his life. Theres no Magus control, yet at least.

Lamia: Went through a big personality change after being wounded in the Gulf of Mexico fight. Before that, she'd already been doing the stutter, implying systems acting up, and she'd gotten lectured hard by Axel on how uncool she was. This seemed to have an effect.

Arado: Arado's definitely matured from how Katina remembers him, but the exact reason for this is unclear. There's the actual trauma from being dead, theres the Shocker Unit cyborging, then theres the remodelling into a W-series, then theres the False Cells forcing him to relive his past, then theres the experience of meeting OG Arado and Seolla and seeing that GOOD END is possible, then theres his Anti-psychodriver powers and the way they not only blunt the False Cells effect, but allow Katinas thoughts and emotions to bleed into his brain.
So yeah, a little complex.

Lenonjayce: Jayce is trying. He keeps trying to get motivated, to get up off his hieny and do something with his new lease of life. But he can't go more than a few minutes without lapsing into an emo state that leaves him unable to act. It's possible that being thrust into a new and unfamiliar world may finally give him something tangible to focus on and a goal to act towards. Or he might just sit on a rock and let a passing kaiju eat him.

No, Tis faked being one of the Machinery Children because Dumi was afraid the Irregulars would recognise her. The disguise worked, although Masaki and Ryuune had their suspicions, events became too distracting for them to check in earnest. Similarly, she shapeshifted the Thugater into the shape of a Bergelmir, causing much confusion among Huckebien fans, but the Irregulars who saw it didn't put two and two together.

Katina has no idea what the Homoculi are capable of. All she knows is, Dumi considers them his children and his best friends after her.

The Grail War is an instant clusterfuck, thats for sure...

Dumi didn't explain this very well, but he implied that they were created when he split off part of himself, mainly out of sheer boredom. It seems Dumi was an odd creature from the very moment he left Dark Brain.

Infernals are the exalt type I know the least about, so I will take your word for it on that...

But I do need to say this: If he is still under the control of the Yozi's, we CANNOT let him get the Grail. Him getting the Grail, means the Yozi's getting the grail if he is bound to one... And that is whole lotta bad shit.

The thing is, making the Infernals was the absolute WORST move the Yozis could make. They have to have free will, you see, otherwise the Gods could just order the Yozis to make them stop...The only leashes they have are Limit and threats.

And its inevitable that sooner or later the Infernals will turn upon their masters...

Any veteran infernal who isn't a complete lunatic, that is. I suspect at least a few Scourges are so fucked up that they either wouldn't care about the effects of limit or they'd be so singlemindedly focused on their urge that they'd be able to almost entirely avoid gaining it.

That said, everyone else would have to, wouldn't they. That said, the process of buying off limit is HILARIOUS.

Not entirely. The process of making an Infernal tends to make them rather... sympathetic to the Yozis. That said, they're FAR more likely to backstab their masters than the Abyssals.

I'd say that on the contrary, the Yozi's worst mistake was letting the neverborn get the Solar Exaltations in the first place. Not because the Deathlords screwed things up and released the Solars, but because giving the Neverborn a way to accelerate their plans is likely to fuck up the Yozi's.

Also, I hope everyone here familiar with Exalted knows who the Ebon Dragon's soon to be waifu is. Because it's pretty fucking obvious who it is.

Well, there IS the offchance that someone could theoretically manage to yoink a Monstrance and get it to Lytek, at which point the Neverborn and the Yozi's would both be utterly fucked, since he'd have a non-cursed exaltation to play around with and once he got all the neverborn ick out of it he could run a comparison of it with a normal Solar essence and figure out what part to fix to remove the curse.
Anonymous Wed 24 Mar 2010 14:02:58 No.4748248 Report

He wouldn't necessarily be able to remove the curse by this method. The exaltation of the first Solar to become an Akuma had a trace of infernal something on it that he was never able to remove even though he could tell exactly what the difference between it and other exaltations. Just because he might be able to find the curse on the exaltation doesn't mean he would be able to remove it.
