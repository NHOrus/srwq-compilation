# Episode 42

##SRWQ Mission 42: Life, the Multiverse, and RAEP

In our last episode, through an epic set of hoodwinks, secret capturings, and some obvious natural 20s, our heroine, Katina Tarask, managed to get herself and most of her friends away from the clutches of Vindel Mauser, and began her epic journey to another dimension. Unbeknownst to her, one of her 'friends' used the oppurtunity to escalate the conflict on Earth, by allowing the Balmarians, allied with the Council of the First and Only, to attack the Shadow Mirrors, allied with Project SRX and the scheming Yukiko Date.

How will our heroine fare on her journey? Will she make it to the Endless Frontier, and glimpse infinity itself? And what will become of those left behind?

Irm grumbles as he scratches at his cast. "Dumi... Where are we going?"

North, Irm.

"I can see that!"

Then why ask the question?

"No... You... Ok, we teleported to America to drop off Mrs Fonda, to the southern islands of Japan to drop off Ms Kobayashi, and to India to drop off Ms Byran. Now that we're done with that... Shouldn't we be going to another dimension, like we said we'd do?"

*The teleportations have taxed my transport mechanisms, they will need some time to recharge. And besides, there's someone we need to pick up. Another friend of mine, who I can't leave behind.*

"Who? And would we have room for him?"

*He has his own ship, and some assistants that could really help with our research. Oh, and Irm... I have to ask that you keep a little secret for him.*

Irm tries to facepalm, but doesn't have enough working fingers in either hand. "What now, Dumi?"

*Nothing much, its just that he's assumed the mantle of the missing Helios Olympus, who as you may have noticed, is one of the Irregulars now. If you could refer to him by that name, that would be super. Thanks!!*

"...Why do we even pretend I'm in command anymore?"

---

"Helios Pimple-us, gotcha!"

*Theres a little more to this sidetrip than just picking up Lalia, Katina. We also need to get through our issues with the Irregulars once and for all.*

"You never struck me as the vengeful sort, Dumi."

*I'm not. The Irregulars can go and have happy lives in homes made of solid gold and have a million babies for all I care. But I need the Compatible Kaiser, and it's onboard the Irregulars main ship. We have to figure out a way of at least getting it to follow us before we leave this world.*

"What is the deal with this Compy-Kaiser thing anyway? You said it was just a mech!"

*Honestly, Katina? I don't know. Dark Brain neglected to mention what he wanted it for. All I know is that it should be a very powerful Super Robot, better than a Grungust and at least a match for the DGG series. Possibly some component of it has dimensional significance, but lacking additional info, I'm forced to grab the whole thing.*

"Hmm...With Wodans Thrudgey-chan, we might be able to beat it down, but if all the other Irregulars get involved, we wouldn't have much chance as we are..."

*Lalia's arrival may alter things slightly, but he still only has his own mech, which is hardly a gamebreaker. We'll need to ruminate on this before we take any action.*

"Can't you, y'know, go to another dimension and get the Compy-Kaiser of that dimension?"

I'm afraid the Compatible Kaiser is a multiplicity point, much in the same fashion as Dark Brain itself. Every universe has a version of it that can exist, but only one can exist at a time...well more accurately, only one exists at any on its own personal timeline, and due to to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect it cannot occur within traversable space-time of itself....There's only one, ok?

"'Kay...Can't we just leave a bug on it or something, so we can leave, get awesome mechs, then come back for it later?"

I...It could work, but again, we'd need an interdimensional communication method, in case it jumps to another world while we're away. Again, that would mean stealing from Gilliam Yeager, risking a peep at Izu Base, or investigating the signal in space. Also...I don't want to risk Dark Brain waiting for us out in the storm, and being emptyhanded when he asks me wh...Oh, there's Lalias ship.

You look out of your porthole and see, waiting in the valley, something that might have been a standard EFA shuttle at one point, but is now almost unrecognisable. The black Stealth Coating and automated AAA turrets look strangely out of place.

You tune into internal comms and here the crackle of the new ships hail. "This is the Illusion of Serenity, Helios Olympos, asking to join your formation and to come aboard."

---

Ring rubs her chin at the sight of the young man walking onto the Eurydice. "I knew Helios Olympus was meant to be young, but not that young..."

You shrug. "He must be some kind of child genius. Like how I am with breaking stuff."

"Katina, you're practically my age."

"Yeah, but I'm a child at heart, and thats what matters!"

"Don't we all know it..."

The young man bows at Despinis and 'Cynthia'. "Its been too long, sis... my friends. Now hopefully, we'll be able to realise our dreams at last."

*Indeed, although we have one last obstacle to face. Perhaps the famed scientist Helios Olympus, and his retinue, can find us a solution?*

"Indeed, Dumi. We'll try our best, allow me to introduce you..."

You never thought of a labcoat as an 'ironic' fashion statements, but somehow the large man who's entered the hangar manages. His frame oozes laid-back-ness like most men his size would ooze sweat, and his grin as he takes in the contents of the Eurydices bay is disturbingly like looking into a mirror.

"Well, quite a feast you've got for us this time, Heel-o! If it wasn't for the exciting dimensional trip business, I'd have to get stuck in to these babies right now."

Ring steps in front of him. "No-one touches the EX without my say-so, and I doubt you'd want to see the Thrudgelmirs insides. Who are you, anyway?"

"Miss Mao! You've forgotten me already? Harry Cooplowski, worked in R&D for 4 months. The middle management didn't seem to like my style, even though I was getting awesome results! You did see those, didn't you?"

"Cooplowski... You're the one that wrecked the 009!"

"Wrecked! I upgraded that baby like no-one else could! Just because your test pilot couldn't handle the G-Sword Diver..."

"Hector was our best test pilot" He's still in the hospital!!"

"Man, how can he call himself the best if he can't surf a huckebien on the moon? That's right, he CAN'T." With this, Cooplowski walks away, leaving Ring rather confused at to what sort of point he just made.

You run up to the large man. "Ooh, Coop, I can call you Coop right?"

"All the cool kids are doing it!"

"Who'd the hot asian chick? I gotta know!!"

The prim woman with the incredibly-out-of-place dyed red hair simply walks past the two of you. "You can call me Dr. Andrews. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be on a ship with proper showers." She storms off, high heeled moon-boots clicking at she goes.

"...She must be mine."

Coop cocks an eyebrow.

"Hey, what about me? Don't I get to be introduced in an awesome fashion?"

"No, Jamie, you don't. Now get back to the Serenity and grab me a bottle of hot-sauce. I need to go find a snack."

---

Harold Cooplowski, experience mech engineer and radical theorist on potential mecha design. Kiva Andrews, ex-EFA combat strategist, now wanted for smuggling weapons for the Shadow Mirrors and DC. And another low-level Anti-Psychodriver. I must say, Lalia, you've done quite a good job with something I only meant as a side-mission for you while I organised the rest of the plan."

Lalia grins. "They're deviant minds, the lot of them, they needed direction, and the mystique of a rock-star scientist living on the edge was enough to draw them in."

Well, we're going well past the edge at this point. The issue of the Compatible Kaiser is our last hurdle. If we can claim it, and leave here, we can finally set ourselves up as we wanted, and finally have real lives, away from the Mission.

The 3 homonculi nod in unison. It's kinda creepy. Luckily everyone else has left the hangar.

---

You walk out of the hangar, your head aswim with the events of the past few hours. Even Lalia sexy behind isn't enough to distract you. You pass a computer terminal, and, after a few seconds, start keying in the comm-frequency Kusuha gave you.

Then you stop. Dumi's earpiece is still in your left ear. If you open this comm-channel, the likelihood is that Dumi will hear, and listen in on your conversation.

"D-Dumi?"

*Yeah, Katina.*

"I-I'm gonna... give some people a call now. I want... I want you to just listen. No sage advice, no I-are-smarter-then-puny-humans stuff, and no flying off in a panic or jamming the signal. Just... listen."

*...Alright, Katina. I trust you.*

You type in the last of the code.

Kusuha's face pops up on the screen. Its a big contrast, between the bright peppy face of this Kusuha compared to the lifeless eyes of the alcoholic you know. "Oh, K-Katina, this is, um, unexpected. How are you getting on?"

"Great! I managed to save a shipful of wounded soldiers from Vindel Mausers evil clutches, and prevented him from getting a Black Hole Engine!"

"Oh! Wow, thats... really something! So, have you left the Shadow Mirrors then?"

"Working on it, still have to break the news to Irm. Er, Kusuha... Back in your world, did you ever meet a dude by the name of Duminass?"

"D-Duminass? How did y... Katina, have you met her?"

"Her?"

"Duminass was a big monster AI, which was sent by Dark Brain to our world. She got damaged or something, and she had amnesia. All she knew was that if she got hold of Kouta's Compachi, she could summon her master and learn where she came from. She chases up all over the Earth as we tried to stop the Shuras, and eventually, her own plans got her hurt badly. She... she had to consume her only friends to survive, and even then, she wouldn't stop. She summoned Dark Brain to our world, and he... he killed her. Called her a defect, and just squished her there and then. We barely managed to stop him ourselves. There was nothing left but Despinis."

You blink as Kusuha finishes the story. "Woah, thats... thats pretty heavy."

"But...Why are you asking me this? Did you meet another Duminuss? Gilliam said he'd seen another, but it didn't attack him."

"I... guess I just wanted to know what the fuss was about. That giant turkey flapping about, causing a ruckus... I wanted to know what the story was."

"Katina, if you do know where the Duminass is... Well, we don't want her to lead Dark Brain to our world, or to yours for that matter. He... he could destroy your planet, or worse. We don't mean Duminass ill, we never would but... Do you want to risk your world to that, after fighting so hard for it?"

"...In this life, you don't choose where you come from, Kusuha. You only choose where you go."

"...Nani?"

"I personally think, this other Duminass, he should be judged based on his actions, not on past experience. You said the same thing about Juergens, remember?"

"Yes, I did, didn't I?"

"Even if theres a zillion other world in this multiverse and there a copy of you in each one, you're not the same person as those other jerks. You're not the Kusuha who pretends to be a nurse while drinking scotch out of a hipflack every 15 minutes."

"...And you're not the Katina who bosses Octo Team around and keeps trying to take RyuKoOh out for a 'test flight'."

"Yeah. Each person is only that who they allow ourselves to become. Whether it be Human, Machine, or Nightmarish Space Vampires who feed on song energy."

"Wait, what was that last one?"

"Stop ruining the moment. Anyway... Thank you, Kusuha. If I ever do meet that other Duminass I'll judge him according on his actions, and suffer the good and ill that comes with it."

"...Why do you keep calling it a he?"

"Oh look, my quarter's running out, darned payphones! Gotta go!"

*...I'll assume that was meant for my benefit.*

"Dumi... Do you want to live?"

*Yes. But more than that, I want to live with Despinis, Lalia and Tis... and I'd like to live with you, if you'll let me.*

"So... why do you follow Dark Brains mission? If you want to live, why risk everything for him? He doesn't care about you, he'll squish you like he did that other one. Heck, even if you do give him the Kaiser, he'll probably kill you anyway, just because he doesn't like that you've been fucking about so long with humans. Dumi... Can't you see your life is more important than the mission??"

*...Katina, I'm hurt. After all we've been through together, do you really think I'm just some computer?*

"No! But you keep going on about this mission, its driving everything you do, I need to break that program."

It's not a program, Katina! It's not something Dark Brain patched onto my OS to kill the Free Thought bugs! I'm not doing this because of a few lines of code! I'm doing this because I'm FUCKING TERRIFIED!!!

"Dumi!"

*I wasn't built by Dark Brain, not in the conventional sense. It was more like he tore off some skin cells and told them to find something for him. I am partially composed of Dark Brains essence. I was born out of his... truth. He IS fear, he IS pain, he IS death. I follow his will not because out of gratitude or control, but because I fear him with the fear of the trillions who've seen him. Because I know the pain that he inflicted on those trillions. And because if I screw up, I and everyone I know and love will be added to that trillion-strong piles, and there will be no-one to mourn them.*

"Do you really trust such a being not to kill you, regardless? Dumi, sometimes the only way to protect those you care about is to fight. Think about it. He's not unbeatable. The Irregulars fought him off when he came to their dimension, right? However powerful he is, he's NOT invincible. Dumi... Can't you be brave? Can't you summon up your courage and stand up to him?"

*...I didn't know what courage was, until I met you, Katina.*

"Ugh... Wow, dunno what to say to that..."

*Look at you, Katina. You're a lot like me, in many ways. You have the mind, the heart, the soul of a full person, but for as long as you can remember, you've been used as a weapon, people have tried to use you like a tool, and then discarded you because you weren't the right shape for them. But even with all that, you've tried to have a life, tried to find a purpose of your own, and screwed up as it may be, you've succeeded, just a little. You're... my inspiration, Katina.*

The tears roll down your face freely now, as you run back towards the hangar. "Oh Dumi!"

*But... whenever I look into your face, or the faces of my Homonculi, all that courage, all that inspiration... it's not enough. To have friends, to have children, that's my dream, but I know it could all be washed away in an instant! All I need is a mech, Katina. A lousy pile of metal and microchips! I can just find it, take it to another world, get one of my idiot siblings to summon that bastard, and escape the madness. One mech, for my life and the lives of everyone I love... why is that so much to ask?*

You run into the hangar, suddenly realise that Dumi is flying outside the ship, and turn to hug Lalia, Despinis and Tis in his stead.

---

"Lt Irm! The R-Blade just launched from the main hangar!"

"What? Who'd piloting i... wait, don't bother answering that. What's she doing?"

"She's landing on Duminass, sir. She's... um...s he's spread-eagled the mech on its surface."

"...She's hugging him. Ok, false alarm, everyone back to your posts."

---

"Dumi... I know you're scared. I've been scared a lot of times too, times I don't even remember, and times I want to forget. But if we let the fear keep us down, it'll be on top of us all our lives, smothering us! We have to stand up, and find a way through the pain... To smash it!"

*Katina, you don't have t-*

"I want to, Dumi. I want to protect you!! Even if you're too scared to protect yourself, I'll do it, and I'll protect your friends and my friends, everyone! The world! The Universe!!!"

*Katina, it's pointles-*

"Killing the people who want to hurt you is never pointless!! You really think he can't be stopped? Like hell he can't!! We'll find a way! Even if we have to go to a million universes, we'll find a way to kill that bastard! We'll show that you don't fuck with Katina Tarask, and you doubly don't fuck with her friends!! As God as my witness, I'll make him pay for making you make me cry!"

*Katina, fighting Dark Brain is a waste of time! It'd be like building a cannon to fight a whale... when all you need to do is feed it, and it'll go away.*

"Dumi, how can you still think about helping that monster?"

*Because, quite apart from all my fears of retribution, its the simplest solution. Look, all he wants is his damned toy mech, unique only in that it has some one-of gizmo that he wants, probably just because he can. Dangle that in front of his face, let him skulk off with it, and everyones in the clear. We don't even have to be exposed, I can just give the Kaiser to another Duminass, one that doesn't have my cheerful disposition and eats babies for shits and giggles. Give it the Kaiser, get the fuck out of Dodge before the summoning, the bad Duminass get its 'reward', Dark Brain takes the mech and uses it to pick his nose or whatever, and we get to be happy! No-ones the worse for wear except one guy doesn't have a mech anymore, and a monstrous villain plaguing a dimension gets some karmic justice. Thats as far as it goes, Katina. Then we can save this world, make it just the way you like it, and our struggles will be over.*

"Dumi... Do you really want to do that?"

*It seems to me like the most painless method. Or you could have me summon Dark Brain how and try to kill his actuality in this dimension, but seeing what happened to the Irregulars dimension that might not be enough. Or you could try to find some force thats truly greater than him and make it end him, but I highly doubt that any force that powerful could be truly benevolent. I've never stopped you from advicing me, Katina, but I just want you to realise: Theres a simple way out that means no-one gets hurt.*

"Dumi... Do you really beleive that?"

*Well I... It's more that... Well, my hope would be that since I'm insignificant compared to him, he won't bother looking for me if I just leave the Kaiser for him. That's he'd forget about the Duminasses and go have his fun elsewhere. On a cosmic scale, we're not important to him.*

"Dumi, I've known bad people like that. Those people don't let their victims get away, they keep dragging them back, making them do 'one more thing' over and over... It won't end unless you make it end."

*Katina...*

"And even if he doesn't go after you, he'll go after someone else! Another world, another ten! He'll use the Kaiser you gave him to destroy his enemies! He won't stop destroying..."

*Katina, are you going to heap the responsibility for the entire multiverse onto me? You think Dark Brain is waiting patiently for me to give him the Kaiser so he can get back to his murder schedule? He's out there destroying things right now, Katina. The only difference is that he might destroy slightly different universes if he gets his new toy, and that he won't have a reason to kill me if we stumble across each other.*

"He doesn't need a reason, Dumi. He feeds off pain, remember? Your pain, your fear of him, your anguish after having struggled so hard to be free... wouldn't that be a tasty morsel to him?"

*...Dammit Katina, stop being so darned logical...*

"Dumi... I'm not going to tell you what to do. This is your future, your life. It has to be your decision, you have to choose what you're going to do now. Otherwise... you'll never be free."

---

Tetsuya smiles broadly at the two girls on the viewscreen. "It's great to see you again!! Princess, Latooni... How have you been holding up?"

Shine Hausen wipes away another tear of joy. "We... It was awful, the Riksent of this world... *sniff* burned away by the falling colony. The survivors where so nice to take us in, and that wonderful Mr Grims..."

"Archibald Grims? What?"

"This one was so charming and kind, completely different from the horrible man of our world. He was more like Sir Raidese than anything!"

"I... don't think Rai would like that analogy. Anyway, patch me through to Gilliam, we need to dis-"

Eita leaps up from his console. "Captain! Contacts just teleported in dead ahead! I-I-It's Duminass, sir!"

"What?"

The fleet arrayed itself behind the mass of orange-purple brain matter. The Illusion of Serenity's cargo door opens, and a four-armed blue mech carefully flies out, taking care not to scratch the muscle car sharing the bay. From the rear of the Eurydice, a non-descript engine block pulls itself free and unfolds to reveal a three-faced mech. The Bergelmir unfolds like a butterfly, turning pink as the wings grow from the side of its face, and it settles on the Thrudgelmirs shoulder again.

*Irregulars... I am Duminass 7. I was sent to this world for one purpose, to find the mech known as the Compatible Kaiser, and give it to my master Dark Brain. For years I have searched, and I found something I never expected to find: My own humanity. I chose a new purpose. I chose life, with my three children, and the friends I'd made here. But a dark force threatens them all, threatens the peace of the entire multiverse, and while that shadow covers us, we will never be free.*

*I... am Dumi, and I... We need your help.*

Tetsuya looks worriedly at the side screen. "Gilliam... can we trust this thing?"

"We certainly have to be careful, but... if its not a ruse, this could be something we can't pass up. Duminass could hold the key to keeping our world safe."

"Right. We'll proceed with the rendevous then, the Hiryu should be here soon. We'll have to risk meeting you in the meditteranean. Then we ca-"

"WHERE'S THE DARK ONE?"

Tetsuya swings around to see the red-armored figure striding onto the bridge. "Touma?"

"Not when I'm the armor! Now let me speak to it! The Warrior has something to say!!"

The Diamond Eye reappears on the main screen, and focuses on the red figure. *Ah, you'll be the Fighter Roar of this world then.*

"The Warrior told me of you, how your kind has chased him and the Kaiser across the multiverse, leaving chaos in your path!"

*I can't speak for the actions of my siblings... This Warrior, I... I can't quite figure out what I'm detecting here... What kind of entity is this?*

"The Warrior is the Dark Ones greatest enemy. He strives to free the multiverse from the chains of darknes."

Tetsuya turns to the other armored figure. "Wait... Duminass can hear it too?"

Sleigh Preistly frowns "Why do you doubt that we can hear the Voice of Justice? Warrior Roar is real, and he's guided us this far, hasn't he? Were it not for him, the Kaiser and Thundergate wouldn't have been able to leave your world and come here to find us."

Tetsuya rubs his head in annoyance. "I'm never going to get used to this job..."

Touma Kanou crosses his arms and frowns over his faceplate. "Duminass 7, do you truly forsake the darkness? Do you truly wish to fight for Justice?"

*I want peace. I want life. And... thanks to Katina, I've seen that I'm not going to get these things while Dark Brain roams the multiverse. I am willing to work against him, I'll fight if I have to, but I'd prefer a smarter solution. If there's some other way to see him off, I'd rather search for that. The idea of me facing him directly...*

"Whats wrong? Are you backing out of this?"

*No, its just... If I ever was that powerful, I... I fear I'd be just like Dark Brain, that any being with so much power would be.*

Touma raises his fist in front of him. "Thats not true, Duminass. If someone has a heart filled with Justice, their purpose will be noble, they will be incorruptible!"

*...I guess I have a lot more to learn, then.*
