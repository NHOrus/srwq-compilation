In our last thread, through an epic set of hoodwinks, secret capturings, and some obvious natural 20s, our heroine, Katina Tarask, managed to get herself and most of her friends away from the clutches of Vindel Mauser, and began her epic journey to another dimension. Unbeknownst to her, one of her 'friends' used the oppurtunity to escalate the conflict on Earth, by allowing the Balmarians, allied with the Council of the First and Only, to attack the Shadow Mirrors, allied with Project SRX and the scheming Yukiko Date.

How will our heroine fare on her journey? Will she make it to the Endless Frontier, and glimpse infinity itself? And what will become of those left behind?

Irm grumbles as he scratches at his cast. "Dumi...Where are we going?"

North, Irm.

"I can see that!"

Then why ask the question?

"No...You...Ok, we teleported to America to drop off Mrs Fonda, to the southern islands of Japan to drop off Ms Kobayashi, and to India to drop off Ms Byran. Now that we're done with that...Shouldn't we be going to another dimension, like we said we'd do?"

The teleportations have taxed my transport mechanisms, they will need some time to recharge. And besides, there's someone we need to pick up. Another friend of mine, who I can't leave behind.

"Who? And would we have room for him?"

He has his own ship, and some assistants that could really help with our research. Oh, and Irm...I have to ask that you keep a little secret for him.

Irm tries to facepalm, but doesn't have enough working fingers in either hand. "What now, Dumi?"

Nothing much, its just that he's assumed the mantle of the missing Helios Olympus, who as you may have noticed, is one of the Irregulars now. If you could refer to him by that name, that would be super. Thanks!!

"...Why do we even pretend I'm in command anymore?"

Calling it now, the fake Helios is Bian Zoldark who barely escaped death, and the fact that he wasn't dead was suppressed by the EFA to avoid having the DC remnants unify under him.

"Helios Pimple-us, gotcha!"

Theres a little more to this sidetrip than just picking up Lalia, Katina. We also need to get through our issues with the Irregulars once and for all.

"You never struck me as the vengeful sort, Dumi."

I'm not. The Irregulars can go and have happy lives in homes made of solid gold and have a million babies for all I care. But I need the Compatible Kaiser, and it's onboard the Irregulars main ship. We have to figure out a way of at least getting it to follow us before we leave this world.

"What is the deal with this Compy-Kaiser thing anyway? You said it was just a mech!"

Honestly, Katina? I don't know. Dark Brain neglected to mention what he wanted it for. All I know is that it should be a very powerful Super Robot, better than a Grungust and at least a match for the DGG series. Possibly some component of it has dimensional significance, but lacking additional info, I'm forced to grab the whole thing.

"Hmm...With Wodans Thrudgey-chan, we might be able to beat it down, but if all the other Irregulars get involved, we wouldn't have much chance as we are..."

Lalia's arrival may alter things slightly, but he still only has his own mech, which is hardly a gamebreaker. We'll need to ruminate on this before we take any action.

START BRAINSTORMING WHILE I FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE DEAL WITH LALIA IS.

....Huh.

I don't suppose there's any chance Lalia is actually Bian Zoldark, is there?

Anywho, there's an easy way to fix this. All we have to do is, have Arado kill Kouta while he's Fighter Roa. Then, we'll "stumble" into the Kaiser, and with no alternative, Katina becomes the new pilot of Compati-Kaiser.

And then we can pull a gigantic JUST AS PLANNED face when asked what we'll do with it first.

Kaiser is probably linked to the original Roa in some way in that killing Kouta will make it useless. We could still steal it, but nobody would be able to pilot it.

Plus, we'd still have a very mad Emi/Shouko and G-Thundergate to deal with. Our best option is to somehow lure it out somewhere alone and within our jump radius. After that, Thrud should be able to deter anything he can throw on us, provided we don't screw up and end up with G-Compatible Kaiser on our asses.

If it makes you feel any better, I really did think about putting Bian Zoldark in somehow, but with the plot the way it was going, I felt he'd just mess up the characterisation I had for ExceLune and VVT. Plus, I had too many mysterious background figures as it was.

Either way, killing Kouta outside of the Kaiser seems like the best option. It saves us the pain of dealing with OVERKAISER SWORD being rammed up our ass.

Also, the more intact it is when we give it to Dark Brain, the better the chance of improving our standing with the evil overlord of the universe! So then, when we become the moon-sized-tentacle-raping-jetzt-overlord, we can have an easier time adding Dark Brain to the harem.

I don't like this one bit. Not only do I doubt we can STEAL the Compatible Kaiser, but I think that obtaining it is a bad idea. Ask if Dumi is sure that he/she/it has its priorities straight. Assumedly, the Compatible Kaiser can't be unique or Dark Brain wouldn't have dumped Dumi into this dimension. Surely there must be another one SOMEWHERE.

I'm still holding true to my original suggestion way back in one of the earlier threads where Bian managed to escape, and he now lives in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere on top of a secret hangar, where it spends his remaining years doing research with the help of his robot maid.

...Okay, maybe all of that wasn't suggested last time, but Bian totally strikes me as the kind of guy who'd make a robot maid in his spare time.

Katina makes Dark Brain her bitch, and then they descend upon the world to rape Lydia, who then in turn infects the machine cells with her nanomachines and during a massive orgy of evil and tentacles, all three of them fuse together to become Perfect Dark Brain, who then inserts a tentacle into the center of the galaxy.

That's right. We're going to rape the entire galaxy.

Under the current priority set, the only way to leave is to either get the Kaiser, which is bad for obvious reasons, or to provoke the Kaiser into following us, which is bad because Kaiser, sword, our ass. The solution is to change the priority set.

Sent Thrud to grab Shouko and the G-Thundergate.
Say that if Roar and Kaiser hand themselves then no harm will come to Shouko. (AND BY HARM I MEAN HOT RAPE) Give them 1 Hour at most to comply.

But make sure your engines are securely ready to jump the moment you have the Kaiser, if you wait to long they'll do something, heroic.
Like Dress up one of their men as a girl, or attack from underground.

If they don't comply, make the Jump, since it might be worth a gamble on the Kaiser making a jumping after Shoko if Roar wants it that bad.

I think Dumi's reasoning is that Dark Brain will know if he leaves the dimension, and assume that Dumi's finished his mission. If he comes to check on his creation and find it's picked up a bunch of pets and no Kaiser...well, we'll have one extremely pissed off eldritch abomination to deal with.

Dumi'll probably gladly accept any alternate solutions we can come up with, but given that this is Dark Brain we're talking about, our options are kinda scarce.

True, but Dumi has implied that Dark Brain somehow does know when Dumi jumps between dimensions. It seems like the only reliable way for him to keep track on his servants, since even he can't be everywhere at once and jumping in periodically would be more trouble then it's worth.

Either way, Dumi knows he has to present Dark Brain with -something- sooner or later, unless he wants to put in his two weeks notice early.

Right. Hence the logic trap - changing what Dark Brain's orders mean to Dumi. Once that's done, we'll have bought some time until we can find a way to properly reprogram Dumi.

If that doesn't fully accomplish the goal, and I'm not sure it does, then we plant a bug on the Kaiser so that it can be kept track of, and convince Dumi that since we now know where it is, we can come back and get it once we've got a sufficiently powerful force that securing it becomes trivial.

"Can't you, y'know, go to another dimension and get the Compy-Kaiser of that dimension?"

I'm afraid the Compatible Kaiser is a multiplicity point, much in the same fashion as Dark Brain itself. Every universe has a version of it that can exist, but only one can exist at a time...well more accurately, only one exists at any on its own personal timeline, and due to to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect it cannot occur within traversable space-time of itself....There's only one, ok?

"'Kay...Can't we just leave a bug on it or something, so we can leave, get awesome mechs, then come back for it later?"

I...It could work, but again, we'd need an interdimensional communication method, in case it jumps to another world while we're away. Again, that would mean stealing from Gilliam Yeager, risking a peep at Izu Base, or investigating the signal in space.

You look out of your porthole and see, waiting in the valley, something that might have been a standard EFA shuttle at one point, but is now almost unrecognisable. The black Stealth Coating and automated AAA turrets look strangely out of place.

You tune into internal comms and here the crackle of the new ships hail. "This is the Illusion of Serenity, Helios Olympos, asking to join your formation and to come aboard."

Ring rubs her chin at the sight of the young man walking onto the Eurydice. "I knew Helios Olympus was meant to be young, but not that young..."

You shrug. "He must be some kind of child genius. Like how I am with breaking stuff."

"Katina, you're practically my age."

"Yeah, but I'm a child at heart, and thats what matters!"

"Don't we all know it..."

The young man bows at Despinis and 'Cynthia'. "Its been too long, sis...my friends. Now hopefully, we'll be able to realise our dreams at last."

Indeed, although we have one last obstacle to face. Perhaps the famed scientist Helios Olympus, and his retinue, can find us a solution?

You never thought of a labcoat as an 'ironic' fashion statements, but somehow the large man who's entered the hangar manages. His frame oozes laid-back-ness like most men his size would ooze sweat, and his grin as he takes in the contents of the Eurydices bay is disturbingly like looking into a mirror.

"Well, quite a feast you've got for us this time, Heel-o! If it wasn't for the exciting dimensional trip business, I'd have to get stuck in to these babies right now."

Ring steps in front of him. "No-one touches the EX without my say-so, and I doubt you'd want to see the Thrudgelmirs insides. Who are you, anyway?"

"Miss Mao! You've forgotten me already? Harry Cooplowski, worked in R&D for 4 months. The middle management didn't seem to like my style, even though I was getting awesome results! You did see those, didn't you?"

"Cooplowski...You're the one that wrecked the 009!"

"Wrecked! I upgraded that baby like no-one else could! Just because your test pilot couldn't handle the G-Sword Diver..."

"Hector was our best test pilot" He's still in the hospital!!"

"Man, how can he call himself the best if he can't surf a huckebien on the moon? That's right, he CAN'T." With this, Cooplowski walks away, leaving Ring rather confused at to what sort of point he just made.

Well, we're going well past the edge at this point. The issue of the Compatible Kaiser is our last hurdle. If we can claim it, and leave here, we can finally set ourselves up as we wanted, and finally have real lives, away from the Mission.

I don't really see how things have changed.

The only flaw we have with the logic bomb is that if Dumi defies Dark Brain, then Dark Brain will be hella pissed at him.

I'm still thinking we should kill Kouta outside of the Kaiser. It really is the easiest option, as even in his Fighter Roa form he can't survive a few well placed bombs or a shot from a sniper mech. Do note, though, that I'm completely for obliterating him with heavy firepower from a mech instead of fighting him hand to hand. Unless he has a swordfight with Wodan.

But I digress. Should my call for asassination fall on deaf ears, I'm for Logic Bomb.

What Anon came up with was

>First, we talk to the irregulars and get as much info on what happened with Dark Brain in their universe as possible. This should get us the fate of Dynamis 3/Duminuss 3 (I.E. Dark Brain blew it up after it summoned him)

>Then ask Dumi what priority is placed on its own survival.

>If Dumi's survival is prioritized higher than getting the compatikaiser and summoning Dark Brain, then we should be able to override Dumi's compulsion to summon DB.
>If it is less, we may need to apply logic to get it to increase the priority. Mainly, that Dumi's mission cannot be accomplished unless Dumi survives, so survival should be a higher priority than obtaining the compatikaiser.

>Likewise, summoning Dark Brain without having the compatible kaiser would inflict his wrath and likely cause Dumi's death, preventing the collection of the compatible kaiser, so survival is once again more important.

>Since survival is more important than both parts of the mission, we can conclude that Survival > Completing the mission. Once Dumi's priorities are appropriately adjusted, we spring the "If you complete the mission, Dark Brain kills you" bit.


My immediate thought is 'You haven't done part one yet.' You haven't talked the Irregulars in a long while, and you haven't talked to the ones on the Kurogane at all, with the exceptions of Bullet and Kusuha. They told you about the stuff with the Shadow Mirrors and the Einst, but you never thought to ask them about Dumi, since his identity had barely come up at that point.

This is true. The only Irregulars who have been in close proximity to Dumi for any length of time were Masaki and Lune, and that was back when he was still stuck as DGG-04. None of them know that there's a rogue Duminass in this universe.

Our best bet would be to track down the Kurogane, and by extension Raul and Fiona. They'd probably be most sympathetic to Dumi's case.

Okay, so if we plan to take the Kaiser, we have to do it when it's alone and without the G Thundergate. Thrudgelmir and base Kaiser are on the same level of power, as both are DGG-class machines, so we should be able to take it.

Then we have the Kaiser. Then the question becomes how to stop Dumi from summoning Dark Brain, who kills us. The answer to that is probably last-second logic bomb. It's an extremely risky plan...but I don't think we can get out of it.

I suggest we leave the Kaiser for later. The only way we might be able to steal it is if the Irregulars are caught up between a battle of Einst/Balmarian/Guneden versus Yukiko/SM/DC and all sides manage to fuck their forces up. Only then we might be able to take the comp. Kaiser without taking mass loses and that's only if:

For the short-term, this means getting into contact with some of the Irregulars, who can tell us the story about what happened with Dark Brain and Duminuss on their side. This lets us know that Dumi will be killed if he summons Dark Brain regardless of success or failure, which is the key to the logic bomb. Then we lay the groundwork of the logic bomb by doing all steps up to "Dumi's survival is more important than immediately completing the mission". Once we have the Kaiser, before Dumi can summon Dark Brain, fire the bomb's detonator - summoning Dark Brain and thus completing the mission will lead to Dumi's demise. This will put Dumi in the position of prioritizing its survival by not completing the mission over immediately completing the mission by summoning Dark Brain - while hypothetically still in the process of completing the mission, it can and must now delay indefinitely.

We asked Dumi about it when we considered the bug - if he can't confirm the Kaiser's position dimensionally, leaving the universe it's in without it will be treated as failure, especially if we encounter Dark Brain in the storm. Of course, if that happens, we're dead no matter what, so...

If we happen to meet up with Dark Brain, Dumi simply tells him that there was no possible way to acquire it with our current forces.

Or, if we're feeling like bastards, we can just point him in the general direction of the Irregulars...

I don't think that there is any reason to discuss the Logic Bomp anymore, we go the Ognumbers, ask them, they tell us stuff, we convince Dumi that Dark Brain might zap us on the spot no matter what we do so we need to at least be prepared to escape when we give him the Kaiser.

You walk out of the hangar, your head aswim with the events of the past few hours. Even Lalia sexy behind isn't enough to distract you. You pass a computer terminal, and, after a few seconds, start keying in the comm-frequency Kusuha gave you.

Then you stop. Dumi's earpiece is still in your left ear. If you open this comm-channel, the likelihood is that Dumi will hear, and listen in on your conversation.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO TALK TO THE IRREGULARS, YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE CHOICE WHETHER YOU'RE GOING BEHIND DUMIS BACK TO DO IT.

Other strategies that have been raised:

Spring the logic bomb without the critical piece (That Dark Brain could kill Dumi anyway: Katina has no knowledge of Dark Brains methods and doesn't know this).

Attract Kaiser out of the Kurogane somehow.

Create a bug: This requires technology you only have one of (back at base with Granzon), and few places to get it.

>The only way we might be able to steal it is if the Irregulars are caught up between a battle of Einst/Balmarian/Guneden versus Yukiko/SM/DC and all sides manage to fuck their forces up.

This is a possible strategy too. You have radios, and frequencies for many of these factions...

I wasn't built by Dark Brain, not in the conventional sense. It was more like he tore off some skin cells and told them to find something for him. I am partially composed of Dark Brains essence. I was born out of his...truth. He IS fear, he IS pain, he IS death. I follow his will not because out of gratitude or control, but because I fear him with the fear of the trillions who've seen him.

Look at you, Katina. You're a lot like me, in many ways. You have the mind, the heart, the soul of a full person, but for as long as you can remember, you've been used as a weapon, people have tried to use you like a tool, and then discarded you because you weren't the right shape for them.

To have friends, to have children, that's my dream, but I know it could all be washed away in an instant! All I need is a mech, Katina. A lousy pile of metal and microchips!

One mech, for my life and the lives of everyone I love...why is that so much to ask?

You run into the hangar, suddenly realise that Dumi is flying outside the ship, and turn to hug Lalia, Despinis and Tis in his stead.

AFTER YOU RECOVER, WHAT WILL BE YOUR RESPONSE?

That makes no sense.

If Dark Brain will wipe out everything anyway, then why bother following him? If the Irregulars could defeat him once, who's to say searching the dimensions for forces of similar strength to fight Dark Brain wouldn't be a better use of Dumi's life than serving Dark Brain?

The fact that Dumi can even act right now in a way that secures it's own freedom shows that Dark Brain isn't always monitoring him, seeing as Shady Cerebrum himself hasn't descended from his throne on high to take the Kaiser.

So if Dark Brain is really so evil, what's stopping Dumi from simply not following it's orders and finding a force to defeat it? If there's an infinite number of universes, surely a few of them must have armies capable of working together to defeat Dark Brain.

"Dumi, how can you still think about helping that monster?"

Because, quite apart from all my fears of retribution, its the simplest solution. Look, all he wants is his damned toy mech, unique only in that it has some one-of gizmo that he wants, probably just because he can. Dangle that in front of his face, let him skulk off with it, and everyones in the clear. We don't even have to be exposed, I can just give the Kaiser to another Duminass, one that doesn't have my cheerful disposition and eats babies for shits and giggles. Give it the Kaiser, get the fuck out of Dodge before the summoning, the bad Duminass get its 'reward', Dark Brain takes the mech and uses it to pick his nose or whatever, and we get to be happy! No-ones the worse for wear except one guy doesn't have a mech anymore, and a monstrous villain plaguing a dimension gets some karmic justice. Thats as far as it goes, Katina. Then we can save this world, make it just the way you like it, and our struggles will be over.

"Dumi...Do you really want to do that?"

It seems to me like the most painless method. Or you could have me summon Dark Brain how and try to kill his actuality in this dimension, but seeing what happened to the Irregulars dimension that might not be enough. Or you could try to find some force thats truly greater than him and make it end him, but I highly doubt that any force that powerful could be truly benevolent. I've never stopped you from advicing me, Katina, but I just want you to realise: Theres a simple way out that means no-one gets hurt.

Or that he won't use the nice, shiny mech you're going to give him to cause far more harm than he could have before? A being like what you're describing... he won't stop till he kills everyone.

Yes, I suppose. Make it clear that you really hope, for everyones sake, that Dumi makes the right choice.

Don't forget to make him promise to give us a bigger mech so we can give him even bigger hugs.

"Dumi...Do you really beleive that?"

Well I...It's more that...Well, my hope would be that since I'm insignificant compared to him, he won't bother looking for me if I just leave the Kaiser for him. That's he'd forget about the Duminasses and go have his fun elsewhere. On a cosmic scale, we're not important to him.

"Dumi, I've known bad people like that. Those people don't let their victims get away, they keep dragging them back, making them do 'one more thing' over and over...It won't end unless you make it end."

Katina...

"And even if he doesn't go after you, he'll go after someone else! Another world, another ten! He'll use the Kaiser you gave him to destroy his enemies! He won't stop destroying..."

Katina, are you going to heap the responsibility for the entire multiverse onto me? You think Dark Brain is waiting patiently for me to give him the Kaiser so he can get back to his murder schedule? He's out there destroying things right now, Katina. The only difference is that he might destroy slightly different universes if he gets his new toy, and that he won't have a reason to kill me if we stumble across each other.

"He doesn't need a reason, Dumi. He feeds off pain, remember? Your pain, your fear of him, your anguish after having struggled so hard to be free...wouldn't that be a tasty morsel to him?"

...Dammit Katina, stop being so darned logical...

"Dumi...I'm not going to tell you what to do. This is your future, your life. It has to be your decision, you have to choose what you're going to do now. Otherwise...you'll never be free."

>wake up
>d'awwwww immensely
>but Dumi's still stuck on giving Dark Brain the Kaiser, even if through a proxy

I...I'm sorry, but I gotta somehow address this in character...

*puts pink camera lanyard on neck*

I've seen this before, Dumi...I've seen someone who wanted to do ANYTHING to run away from some eldritch dread that threatened existence itself. Even knowing all she'd sacrifice in the process, she was going to do it anyway, to appease that horror back into dormancy.

I...I couldn't let her go through with it. If you're willing to throw your life on the line to buy a temporary measure for the safety of others...wouldn't it be best to just gamble it all on a permanent solution instead? Win, and nobody has to deal with that pain, now or later. Lose...and, well, at least YOU don't.

As a man who bets it all on tough odds, I beg you, Dumi...please, trust Katina on this hand.

Tetsuya smiles broadly at the two girls on the viewscreen. "It's great to see you again!! Princess, Latooni...How have you been holding up?"

Shine Hausen wipes away another tear of joy. "We...It was awful, the Riksent of this world...*sniff* burned away by the falling colony. The survivors where so nice to take us in, and that wonderful Mr Grims..."

"Archibald Grims? What?"

"This one was so charming and kind, completely different from the horrible man of our world. He was more like Sir Raidese than anything!"

"I...don't think Rai would like that analogy. Anyway, patch me through to Gilliam, we need to dis-"

Eita leaps up from his console. "Captain! Contacts just teleported in dead ahead! I-I-It's Duminass, sir!"

"What?"

The fleet arrayed itself behind the mass of orange-purple brain matter. The Illusion of Serenity's cargo door opens, and a four-armed blue mech carefully flies out, taking care not to scratch the muscle car sharing the bay. From the rear of the Eurydice, a non-descript engine block pulls itself free and unfolds to reveal a three-faced mech. The Bergelmir unfolds like a butterfly, turning pink as the wings grow from the side of its face, and it settles on the Thrudgelmirs shoulder again.

Irregulars...I am Duminass 7. I was sent to this world for one purpose, to find the mech known as the Compatible Kaiser, and give it to my master Dark Brain. For years I have searched, and I found something I never expected to find: My own humanity. I chose a new purpose. I chose life, with my three children, and the friends I'd made here. But a dark force threatens them all, threatens the peace of the entire multiverse, and while that shadow covers us, we will never be free.

I...am Dumi, and I...We need your help.

Tetsuya looks worriedly at the side screen. "Gilliam...can we trust this thing?"

"We certainly have to be careful, but...if its not a ruse, this could be something we can't pass up. Duminass could hold the key to keeping our world safe."

"Right. We'll proceed with the rendevous then, the Hiryu should be here soon. We'll have to risk meeting you in the meditteranean. Then we ca-"

"WHERE'S THE DARK ONE?"

Tetsuya swings around to see the red-armored figure striding onto the bridge. "Touma?"

"Not when I'm the armor! Now let me speak to it! The Warrior has something to say!!"

The Diamond Eye reappears on the main screen, and focuses on the red figure. Ah, you'll be the Fighter Roar of this world then.

"The Warrior told me of you, how your kind has chased him and the Kaiser across the multiverse, leaving chaos in your path!"

I can't speak for the actions of my siblings...This Warrior, I...I can't quite figure out what I'm detecting here...What kind of entity is this?

"The Warrior is the Dark Ones greatest enemy. He strives to free the multiverse from the chains of darknes."

Tetsuya turns to the other armored figure. "Wait...Duminass can hear it too?"

Sleigh Preistly frowns "Why do you doubt that we can hear the Voice of Justice? Warrior Roar is real, and he's guided us this far, hasn't he? Were it not for him, the Kaiser and Thundergate wouldn't have been able to leave your world and come here to find us."

Tetsuya rubs his head in annoyance. "I'm never going to get used to this job..."

Nice idea. Bad in practice. However, we may want to make mental note to do so if Touma and Sleigh cause a breakdown in negotiations.

...Wait, if Roar's a multiversal singularity like the Kaiser, Cobray/the Dis, etc. and is some sort of overmind that jumped from Kouta to Touma in the shift to the SMverse...

...then exactly WHO is he hijacking in EXCEED no sekai?

Touma Kanou crosses his arms and frowns over his faceplate. "Duminass 7, do you truly forsake the darkness? Do you truly wish to fight for Justice?"

I want peace. I want life. And...thanks to Katina, I've seen that I'm not going to get these things while Dark Brain roams the multiverse. I am willing to work against him, I'll fight if I have to, but I'd prefer a smarter solution. If there's some other way to see him off, I'd rather search for that. The idea of me facing him directly...

"Whats wrong? Are you backing out of this?"

No, its just...If I ever was that powerful, I...I fear I'd be just like Dark Brain, that any being with so much power would be.

Touma raises his fist in front of him. "Thats not true, Duminass. If someone has a heart filled with Justice, their purpose will be noble, they will be incorruptible!"

...I guess I have a lot more to learn, then.
