We'll be taking this one a little easier, my posts will be a lot more sporadic and the thread could be used for a few days until it fills to autosage level.

Anyway, to set the scene

You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask. Educated at The School, you've picked up the contraversial dress code, but not the whole following orders and keeping your crazy to yourself bits. With nothing else to do, you joined the Earth's Liberation Front, which led to membership in Shadow Mirror.

On the day the Shadow Mirror were planning to retreat to the OGverse, the OGverse struck first, capturing the Lygues portal for themselves and scattering the Shadow Mirror forces over both their own planet and the Endless Frontier in general. They claimed they did this to stop the fearsome Dark Brain from destroying their dimension, but you're fairly sure that's just a cover story by your old crush Arado Balanga, to explain how he came back from the dead after you choked him to death in a fit of jealous rage.

An incident involving this new Arado picking up a fresh scar resulted in your former teammates locking you up. However, Dumi-chan, the friendly AI that runs a super robot you found, decided to save you from the totally deserved imprisonment, and stole you away on the Trilobite cruiser he had been trusted to fly.

You're now inside the mech hangar of the Trilobite, as your 'friends' Tausendfuessler dives to lower altitude, presumably to equalise the cabin pressure after Dumi ripped a hole in the side.

WHAT DO YOU DO??

You're alone on the Trilobite with Dumi, or at least you should be. Theres not a whole lot the Tausendfuessler can do to stop you without actually launching mechs: It's a transport shuttle, the Trilobite is a stealth insertion cruiser. The Fuessler is essentially a tin can with wings compared to your new ship.

Katina should attempt to get back together with the rest of her crew in a way that convinces them she is more of an asset that liability.

Once again, blaming a lot of her craziness on lasting affects of School drugs/conditioning would be a great excuse. Maybe Dumi has some sort of scanner in its cockpit? Would be easy to write off since it's a DGG. Then there may be some sort of medical bay in the trilobite as an alternative.

"I....I didn't mean like that!! I wanted to be let out, not torn out! Fix it! Fix it now!"

The DGG-04's head turns and looks at the crushed remains of the Tausendfeussler's port toilet in its hand. I'm afraid mid-air aircraft maintenance is not one of my functions.

"But...No!! It wasn't supposed to be like this! All I wanted was everyone to listen to me and maybe service me sexually every so often!!"

From my limited experience, getting large numbers of people to do those kinds of things is not trivial.

"Look, just...Just save them, and then we..We can make some fake medical evidence!! We'll pretend you can scan my brain, and then you can say that it's not my fault, that I have brain problems from all the stuff the School did to me, put codes and viruses in my head. Then we can get back together again."

You're vaguely aware that your eyes are tearing up at this point.

That...is one possibility, but its complicated by them not only having doubts in you, but doubts in me due to my actions. We would have to construct a massive web of lies, which given the collection of personalities aboard the Tausendfuessler, would probably only work on some of them.

The other possibility...is for you to cut your ties, and come to meet my friends.

WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT???

From an in-character knowledge perspective, Arado never mentioned anyone except Dark Brain. I don't recall anything specific about Dumi being mentioned in Katinas presence: As far as I can tell, she just sort of accepted him once she got into the Raioh. You literally haven't asked anyone who or what he is, except Dumi himself.

"NO! I don't want any of your silly robot friends!! I want my friends!!."

A slight pause. Very well. Head to the Trilobites medical bay and lie on the restraining couch. I'll operate the restraints for you. The initial story will be that I rescued you from committing suicide, and have you under sedation. Keep a comm-bead in your ear, and I'll keep you informed of developments as we go.

The restraints close around you, enough to appear locked, but loose enough that you can wriggle out of them. You turn your head to hide the comm-bead as you listen in to Dumi's chat with the others.

Kai's voice: "Prime directive??"

My programming will not allow me to let the pilot of Dynamic General Guardian Unit 3 die, if any probability of survival exists. This extends outside of actual battle, and even if the pilot is attempting reckless or suicidal actions.

Irm snorts. "Sounds like just the thing Katina needs, a robot nanny."

I am conducting an analysis of Katina's mental condition using the Trilobites equipment, and discover the source of the instability. In the meantime, I fear my rash actions means using the Tausendfuessler further is unwise. Transferring completely to the Trilobite is the optimal choice for continued survival.
DO JOHNATHAN, IRM, RUSSEL, KAI, LATOONI, IBIS, RIO AND RYOTO BUY THIS, AND AGREE TO TRANSFER OVER?

Majority rules, of course. Dumi will of course give piloting over to the humans once they're aboard.

However, there's only so much space in the Trilobite for mechs. It's rated for a dozen PT-sized units, but super robots take up 3 spaces, so you would only have 6 slots remaining: Any more than that and you're stacking mechs on top of one another, which would take too much time to put them in, and get them out.

Quick reminder of Tausendfuessler's complement:

Assault Lander (counts as 3)
Captured Wild Wuerger with one leg
R-Blade with no arms
Gespenst with no Arms
Sleigh's Gespenst, which is fully repaired
Randgrith that needs an overhaul.

The Tausendfuessler can still fly, but its top speed has been cut in half: It would take over 10 hours to get to California with it lumbering along. The Trilobite is much faster, and could make it in just under 4.

The Tausendfuesslers EOT-enhanced reactor overloads, and the ammo-less Randgrith and dismembered torso of the R-Blade melt to scrap in the heat of an atomic fireball.

In the Trilobites hangar sit the Assault Lander, the two Gespensts, the captured PT and a pile of spare ammo, weapons and quickly scavenged parts. It's a tight squeeze, but theres enough room to restart mech repairs.

In the medical bay, you feign sleep as Dumi relates his 'findings'. At least, you think that should go in quotation marks, what he's saying sounds scarily plausible...

"So you're saying the School's programming failed on her? She wouldn't be the first one." Latooni is as emotionless as ever.

Failed would probably be the wrong term to use, as it implies the Schools equipment is at fault. Given that I'm detecting traces of hynosis, memory alteration therapy, and outright nerve stapling, in multiple regions of the brain, I don't beleive thats possible. It appears that somehow, her mind is attempting to actively reject all of these changes. The irrational behaviour and inconsistent thought patterns are a result of conflict between the personality that was constructed in her mind using School's equipment, and some process in her brain which is attempting to restore the original."

Kai grunts. "No offense, D.U.M.I., but I find this a little hard to swallow from a computer meant to run an oversized motorcycle."

I'm not merely a combat AI, Mr. Kitamura. My functions also include the full analysis and support for the Raioh and its LIOH System, which interfaces with the pilots mind. If I were not capable of psychological and neurological analysis, I would not be able to do my job."

"Hmmph. Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to get a second opinion before we let her out on her own again. This LIOH system is derived from the DC's GEIM system, right?"

The entire Dynamic General Guardian system is based on EOTI research and DC engineering, retrieved by Shadow Mirror just after Bian Zoldark's death.

"Well then, once we get to California, we should be able to find someone to back up your findings."

If we are fortunate, yes.

SRWQ SPECIAL DISC 1: VillettaQuest

You are Captain Viletta Vadim, current commanding officer of the SRX. Mere hours ago, you were partaking in what could be the most important mission of your life, assaulting the Shadow Mirror universe to prevent Dark Brain from discovering your own. As your group was about to exit the dimensional vortex, Gilliam gave the order to exit the ships. Ryusei, Rai and Aya had just deployed, and you and Mai were just about to launch, when a strange energy wave hit the Hiryu Kai.

When you came to, the Hiryu was upside down, and crawling with Shadow Mirror troops. You and Mai broke out of the hangar with Leona and Lamia, and were assaulted by a group of Gespensts, Randgriths and, most worrying of all, another Angelg. Lamia stayed behind to cover your retreat as you fled north.

The three of you have been shadowing the Hiryu ever since. You've tried to get in contact with the others but there's some sort of all-spectrum jamming going on, seemingly from orbiting EFA satellites. Signposts you've passed by indicate you're in Wyoming, USA, about a state away from where you're meant to be, and heading further west. From what you can tell, the Hiryu is occupied by several dozen Shadow Mirror troops, enough to take the crew hostage. They have 5 Gespensts, 4 Randgriths, both Angelgs, and the Soulgain, which apparently was what forced Lamia to surrender.

Leona, flying at higher altitude to scout, reports in. "Captain, the Hiryu has been intercepted. A Space Noah class came out of the Rockies and is deploying PTs, something like two dozen. They're launching in response."

WHAT DOES VILETTA DO? Feel free to get closer to ascertain the situation better: You're in the foothills of the Rockies and theres a lot of cover.
Sciencegar Sciencebolt Tue 26 Jan 2010 20:20:00 No.4435109 Report
Also, the R-Blades Tonfas are detachable weapons, not arm-mounted. You can use them with Gespenst arms, you just need to adjust your weapon hardpoints slightly.

Fixing both the Bluepensts arm to workable standard, or using the R-Blades mangled right arm instead, will take about the same length of time and would probably give the same results. However, if you're going to get it overhauled later, using the original arms is a better idea.

It all depends on how long you're planning to keep the Gespenst. Also, the DC are less likely to have proper Gespenst parts than a Shadow Mirror base: They still rely mostly on the Lion series. The EFA's mass production of Gespenst happened after the first DC war.

Also, I should probably mention:

Viletta is in the Huckebein MkIII. You were forced to abandon the Boxer Frame in the Hiryu, and obviously they won't be launching the G-Impact Cannon if you need it.

Mai is in the R-Gun Powered.

Leona is in her Seigarlion.

Fix up the original Gespenst's arms, it'll be better than just relying on one mangled one from the R-Blade. Plus we can always take the tonfas and use em as swords if adjusting the hardpoints proves problematic.

And Viletta and friends should move closer to monitor the situation. No sense launching if everyone shoots in your direction first.

Viletta powers up her boosters. "We're going in closer, but no rash actions yet. If we act rashly we could endanger the Hiryu even more. If I give the order, we're pulling out and returning to TLI, is that understood??"

The other two women reluctantly acknowledge.

The team head forward and find a gully that shelters them from stray fire, but still gives them a good view of whats going on. The EFA ship is unmistakably the Shirogane, but its been significantly altered: Apparently instead of simply fixing it after the Granzon took its bow off, they gave it a new bow with extended mech hangars and launch catapults. These have enabled it to launch twice the normal complement of PTs, even though its supporting fire is basically non-existent.

The EFA forces are almost completely Grungusts Mk-IIMs, with two exceptions: A blue Alt Eisen Nacht, which Viletta should have heard about from Axel during the Dark Brain crisis, and what appears to be the Wildschwein. The Shadow Mirror forces are badly outnumbered, but show no fear, taking the fight directly to the enemy. The fighting is bloody in the centre, with the Angelg leading the charge, while the Nacht and the Soulgain take their fight into a valley to one side. Rockslides start to form as their battle shakes the mountains...

The Hiryu Kai is staying out of the fight behind a hill, and it lightly guarded with only a few PTs. Its firepower would probably secure victory for the Shadow Mirrors fairly easily, but they must not want to risk the crew attacking them. The team can clearly see the Wildschwein is leading a squad of EFA Gespensts around the battle, headed towards the Hiryu.

WHAT DOES VILETTA DO?

Chances the Wildschwein is being piloted by Shadow-OG character: high. I'm guessing their Angelg is in the hands of W17.

Do we have a decent chance of taking on the small EFA force and the SM force together? If we can't it might be good to have them fight each other, since Axel and W17 are definitely going to be occupied for awhile and those are the big threats. Then sweep in afterwards and clean up the victors, grab the Hiryuu, and run into the sunset. We can afford any delays in attacking, though, since that will probably bring down W17. Axel's probably not going anywhere but we don't want to attract Beowulf's attention.

Unlike SM Katina, Viletta's not the kind of woman to be crippled by indecision.

Also note that the Wildschwein and the 4 Gespensts with it are bearing down on a total of 3 SM Gespensts. The Hiryu Kai's weapons could probably see them off, but you don't know if they're even active. You could get a little closer and scan the ship, and maybe the enemy forces if you like.

Overall it looks like the Shadow Mirrors have better mechs, but the EFA pilots are better. Given how the Shadow Mirrors you fought before were well-trained soldiers, you'd have to guess this is some special EFA unit.

Plus since we're piloting machines that don't exist in this world chances of just becoming prisoners is high. (horrific cyborg/SCHOOL modifications: maybe?) Either way we don't get much out of joining the EFA unless we pretty much instantly stab them in the back. Which means they're now our enemies and will be gunning for us.

On the other hand, the SMs are very definitely out for our blood. I don't know if we could convince them to let us act as free agents, and since we explicitly came here to wreck all their plans they'd probably toss us in the clink just like the EFA.

...there are two Huckebein Mk IIIs. Two. In the entire world. We are piloting one. It is the super-powered prototype running on the magical space energy. It is not a grunt mech. Just because it currently doesn't have the Boxer or Gunner frames attached does not mean it is a grunt mech. It is the frame of a miniature SRX.

Also, the existence of mass-produced MK IIs has nothing to do with the idea of sacrificing one of our two Mk IIIs. They are entirely different machines. And let me remind you, again, that Tronium is the rarest substance in the entire universe and if we lose some we are not getting any more unless we literally go to war with the Balmerians over it or beat up this EFA's SRX. Given your plan involves possibly also blowing up the R-Gun Powered, our chances of being able to defeat their SRX drop exponentially the longer we leave you in charge.

Blowing up a Tronium Engine will no doubt kill everyone involved, and even if you survive, losing a Tronium sample isn't worth it. Nor is losing a Huckebein MkIII, the strongest real-type ever created and one of only two in the entire world.

Now, the -threat- of a Tronium explosion, on the other hand...both the EFA and the Shadow-Mirrors know how dangerous Tronium is. Being able to state that you have two units with engines that will evaporate -everyone- if they don't cooperate is a pretty nice bargaining chip.

Wasn't the whole purpose of adding the Tronium engine on to the Huckebeins MK 3 was because it was a tenfold more stable than the black hole engine?

Does that make the Black hole engine terribly unstable or the Tronium engine incredibly stable?

Character shields are strong but not impenetrable. I'll mostly be running it as I do my tabletop RPGs: Main characters aren't going to get killed, but they can get themselves killed. I.e. if you guys fuck up (or insist), characters can die.

No pressure or anything.

>>4437067

The R-Guns energy reserves are a little depleted from chasing after one of the fastest ships in the OGVerse, but theres more than enough for several Metal Genocider shots. A proper HTB shot wouldn't be possible though: Even if you could bodge together some connection between the Hucky-3 and the R-Gun in a few minutes, the Mk 3's reactor is meant to power the Gunner and Boxer Frames, not a cannon capable of shooting things into the sun. The tronium engine might be able to produce that much power, but it would still melt the Mk3 itself.

Now, unless we're going to decide on something definite for once, I'm going to do a plot development.

It's both, really. The SRX is stupidly unstable and makes the already kind of unstable Tronium bad enough you need to have a separate guy whose entire purpose is to make sure the damn thing doesn't explode.

Why they gave the job to a guy who blew up the first piece of EOT he got in the cockpit for...I dunno. Expendable?
Sciencegar Sciencebolt Wed 27 Jan 2010 07:05:00 No.4437187 Report
If I had to guess, I'd say the R-Gun and Hucky-3 have limiters on their reactor output, so they have a high consistent output, but they can't raise their output to SRX levels because its simply not safe. When you do the HTB manuver, the limiter is released when Rai taps in the Everyone-Chill-I've-Got-This Code, and you get the full effect.

I've been playing up the angle since it makes things far more interesting, but canonically, I'm not sure. The main strike against them is that one of their top aces is some kind of Einst-powered monstrosity, but theoretically, Beowulf could be the only thing wrong with them. I doubt it though.

Aaaaanyway, the plot needs to move forward, on a slightly different track but mostly similar for the time being, so...

Viletta activates her laser comms system and locks onto the Wildschwein.

"EFA pilot, do not attack that vessel! It's a friendly unit than has been captured by the Shadow Mirror! There are innocents aboard, do not fire!"

A voice responds to her. A cold, emotionless voice, without pity or mercy. The kind of voice Viletta heard from the most ruthless and unrelenting of her enemies.

"...I have my orders."

Even a cynic like Vilette never imagined Shine Hausen speaking like that.

"She's going for the Hiryu!!" Mai bursts forward, transforming the R-Gun as she goes.

The Circle Zanber slices diagonally through the Shadow Mirror standing atop the Hiryu, as his two allies are pinned by the attacks of Shine's four minions.

"Need the range...Metal Genocider!!" A blue beam of pure destruction lances across the hills, passes over the Hiryu's hull close enough for the paint to bubble, and rips a massive chunk out of the nearby cliff-face. But the Schwein had begun moving before Mai had even pressed the trigger.

"Mai!! Be careful, that pilot could be extremely dangerous!" If Shine has the same abilities as in our world, she'll be tough to beat even in an older mech like the Schwein, and theres a high probability it'll be upgraded to augment her. GEIM, T-Link, Uranus, take your pick, any one of them could make her tough to stop...or even to survive.

Leona has already caught up with Mai, and the Wildschwein has dissappeared behind the Hiryu, seemingly using it as cover.

WHAT WILL VILETTA DO?

>>4437539
Ha, evil Shine. Probably the only way to really beat her is to box her in so the only way out is for her to get hit, but that's risky and takes a lot of mechs. We can't really ignore her at this point either. Maybe have Leona try to keep her busy while Mai and Viletta go for the rest of the SM mechs?

We can probably assume that Lefina can't regain command to help or start getting the Hiryu out of there. Or maybe we should contact the bridge and see if we can't convince the SMs that Shine is a danger to everyone.

"Mai! Leona! Distract that Wildschwein! I'll do what I can to fix this situation!!" As the R-Gun and Seigarlion fly around the Hiryu, Viletta opens fire on the EFA Gespensts. Photon bursts took the legs off two as she readjusted her comms.

"Axel, release the Hiryu Kai."

"Wha-?" Alex landed on his feet, then dodged to one side as cannon shells tore up the rock where he'd been. "You're the Irregulars who've been chasing us! What the hell makes you think you can make demands of me?"

The Roches Saber takes the arms off another EFA mech, and the kick puts him down. "The EFA are aiming for the Hiryu. One of their aces is trying to sink it, and the Shirogane is manuvering to fire on it!"

Viletta saw the Seigarlion fly past as shells and missiles trace the path it's taking, or rather, just about to take.

Axel barely manages to catch the Nachts arm, and with a twirl sents the blue behemoth into a nearby cliff face.

"If the Hiryu is sunk, you're stuck here Axel. It doesn't matter how good you think you are, the EFA will have you in their net, and even the mighty Soulgain will be pounded down to nothing. You need that ship."

"I decide what I need!" Axel jumps over the Nacht as Beowulf comes out of the crater, and lands on the ridge above. As he does, he sees the remnants of his troops: Barely half a dozen, all damaged, with only a one-winged Angelg still able to fight.

"You know I'm right, Axel."

"D-...Dammit! Trooper squad, allow the captured ship crew to manuver the vessel! Shadow Mirrors, begin a fighting retreat!

"I'll have words with you later, Irregular."

The Fang Slasher cuts at the Wildschweins arm as Shine twists to dodge Leona and Mai's attacks at the same time. The Circle Zanber goes dead.

"I'm looking forward to it, Axel."

"You're outmatched, Princess. We don't need three mechs to make a three-pronged attack!"

The Photon burst singes the back of the Schweins left leg. The first T-Link Boomerang grazes the left shoulder. The second bisects the machine gun.

"Damn you! T-link weaponry is cheating!!"

"So is aiming at target who don't fight back!"

Viletta smiles to herself as she fires on the oncoming EFA. Her ice-cool routine from earlier is cracking now that she isn't in control anymore. Seems she's a teenage girl underneath it all, after all.

Leona's beam shots dig into the Schwein's rear armor. "Go home princess. You should know you have no future here."

"I..I've already won! I'VE ALREADY WON!!!"

The angels surround her. Everywhere is both green and pink at once. The young girl screams and lashes out, but she hits only air. The Angelg's blow takes off the Wildschein's head and left arm, and the wailing girl falls to earth.

Wow. Now you did it yet again. You never learn, do you? Kindly STOP spamming, harassing and generally attacking the best site on the Web immediately: www. anon
talk
. com. We DO NOT want you there. We never did. GOT IT? If you want these messages to cease, simply STOP fucking with us ENTIRELY, remove ALL lying troll articles about AT and kill all the illegal clones (using whatever method necessary). Get the domain unbanned from all the ISPs that you got it banned from. Then and only then will you never be bothered by these messages again. However, every single time we see the slightest attack or spam on our site (which can be reasonably expected to origin here or any related "chan"), you will get 568 more of these messages posted as a result. It's really up to you. This is a promise that WILL be kept up indefinitely if need be. We are not at all afraid of you chantards.

Yours sincerely, an anonymous AnT and general well-doer of the Internet as a whole. Thank you in advance for your cooperation and kindly get the fuck off of our board.

Thread is nearly full, ending RPG posts and going into discussion modo. New thread here:

And if none of you smart little bastards have twigged the rest of the story by now, I'm a much better mystery writer than I thought.
