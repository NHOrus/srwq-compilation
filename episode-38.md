# Episode 38

##SRWQ Mission 38: Crossovers? In my SRW? It's more likely than you think

"I've found you at last, Boatlights!" Lydia's body erupts with deadly nanobot tentacles, which form into machineguns and chainsaws. "You're going down!"

"Silly girl!" You shout, brandishing your Zankantou. "Katina Tarask is never alone! Harem, attack!"

"Right away!" Dumi's 13-year-old female body flies through the air, spitting laser beams.

"Yes mistress!" The two Arados charge in, their dresses matching perfectly.

"We're going to have fun with her!" Alfimi draws her katana and dances towards the fight.

"Mmmm-mmpph!!" Latooni cheers through the ball-gag as she takes aim with her sniper rifle.

***

*Katina?*

"Mugh!" You leap up on the bed. Your pulse is racing, and your panties are little wet.

"Dammit Dumi! Don't wake me during the good dreams!"

*I'm sorry Katina, I really am, but theres a minor emergency.*

"It's 4am!"

*One of the people you rescued from the Neviim has run off, Katina. And she took the alien mech with her.*

---

There seems to be some minor alarum over the dissappearance of Radha Byran, but no-one else seems to be mobilising. You grumble to yourself as you climb into the Raioh. Taking off, Dumi flies alongside you.

*Like a speed boost?*

"Eh, sure."

Dumi morphs once more into his Transport form, and you land atop of him, as he clamps the Raioh's feet securely to his hull. The combination boosts off, and you've soon breached the sound barrier.

*I see her ahead, she's making good progress, but nothing amazing. I should be able to secure a laser comm with her if you like.*

"Oh Radha honey, we won't make you stay! But running off my yourself won't do you any good! You'll just get lost and run out of fuel, and then you'll be stuck in the middle of the jungle or the sea or something. Come on, give us back the mech, and we'll get you home properly."

"Y...You mean it? Really?"

"Well... to be blunt, otherwise you're dead weight stinking up the camp."

*Eloquent as ever, Katina. Unfortunately, with the interdimensional storm, I don't think I can use my teleport safely, so if we want to get to India and back in a reasonable timeframe, I'll have to use a suborbital overboost. The chance of being picked up is quite high.*

"Can we get her a transport or shuttle or something? Something we don't need, you know."

*I was of the understanding that the Shadow Mirrors needed every ship they could get right now. Also, I don't think Radhas a qualified pilot. It seems she's able to control the Balmar mech only thanks to inserted mental training, judging from her brain activity.*

"Oh... Well, maybe we should leave her of somewhere, and let her make her own way."

*Katina, the entire Africa continent is under alert thanks to our recent shenanigans. The EFA will have stepped up security, particularly around the shuttleports. And need I remind you that she's been missing for several years, and thus won't have valid ID or a passport. The alien uniform doesn't help either.*

"Oh."

*Also, she has no money to pay for flights. And neither do you.*

"Damnit Dumi, one day your being right constantly is gonna backfire on you hard."

"Ok, Radha, we'll get you home, don't worry about that. But the thing is, right now's not the best time. We're all kinda busy with stuff, and theres no-one free who can drop you off. If you can come back with me, we'll sort out your trip back, once we have the breathing room. Ok?"

"...Alright. I... apologise for acting rashly, but... I-I'm a pacifist, I don't beleive in this kind of warfare. I don't see the benefit of the bloodshed you're planning, so I can't, won't support what you're doing."

"Didn't I explain about the aliens in government? Them trying to take over and turn humanity into... stuff? None of that change your mind, at all?"

"I'm sorry, I suppose its just... I can't imagine what you're saying being reality, it just seems so odd. Besides, I've met aliens. For a period, I thought I was one, and from what I can remember, they weren't truly different from us... not fundamentally. I just can't see... even if these First aren't from Earth, that doesn't mean they're not... human, deep down."

"...What."

The Ezekiel lands atop of Dumi, and the whole assembly heads back to the Trilobites.

"Didn't I show you the gun-camera footage of those things? The tentacles, the being the size of PTs, the general wierdness, doesn't any of that convince you they're inhuman."

"...Thats merely their bodies. I'm speaking of their minds, their souls."

"Souls?"

"Did Major Kitamura not say that they have been here for thousands of years, hidden among us? That would mean centuries of co-existence without anyone realising their presence, beyond the odd legend of demons and monsters. That would not be possible if they did not understand humanity, and to understand something is to become it."

"...Ok, you've lost me again."

*She's merely intimating that the First appear to be altering themselves as much as they are altering humanity. Their process of assuming control of the Federation is the culmination of centuries of subtle political and humanitarian manipulation, simply to make the world capable of being controlled by one government. If the First were immutably alien compared to humanity, they wouldn't be capable of this level of subtlety, because their understanding of human psychology and culture would be rudimentary at best. You're right in saying that they're physically quite distinct from anything from Earth, but mentally, they can function as humans, to an astoundingly accurate degree.*

"...Huh... Wait, are you taking her side?"

*I'm playing devil's advocate, Katina.*

"Isn't that a Keanu Reeves movie?"

*...Radha, I'm not sure you're going to get through to her on this one.*

---

Irm starts to fold his arms, but a jab of pain reminds him that one is still in a cast, and he simply stands tall. "I sympathise with your predicament, Ms. Byran. I know not everyone has the will to join Shadow Mirror, and I wouldn't dream of asking you to fight. But for the time being, theres not much we can do for you. Perhaps... Do you have medical training?"

Radha nods. "I was training as a psychologist before... the abduction, and I'm a certified yoga instructor."

"Not perfect, but it'll do. You can help out with the wounded, then. We have only a few doctors and the nurses are overstretched, they'll appreciate any help they get."

You and Irm lead Radha into the main medbay, and its only now you realise that there are people you know in here. Johnathan waves at Irm from his bed with his good arm. Ryoto finishes dressing and is making his bed. A scarred figure you recognise as Toby Watson sits looking at his partner Setsuko, comatose in the next bed over. And Kai and Kar-Wai stand beside Rings bedside, all three looking at the door to the operation theatre intently.

"Hey, slacker, what the hell you doing, forcing a sweet young girl like Rio to work in your place! Get the fuck out of here!"

"H-Hey! I had a concussion! I could barely stand up straight most of the day! Why, I could stil-"

"Save me the bullshit, and prove that you're a man! Now get out there, and fix Kai's Gespenst, like you were meant to do three days ago!"

Ryoto considers answering back, but decides against it, and walked out of the room towards the hangar. You grin, and then turn to the group at the far end of the room.

"Whats up with you lot, moping around here?"

Kar-Wai scratches his bald pate, clearly unused to it being shaved clean. "Well, I was in for a checkup, seeing which of these chunks of metal still in me were removable and which are replacing vitals, and I ran into Kai here, sweating bullets. Seems one of his students is in there, getting treated."

Kai grunts. "Docs said it was safer to give Hugo limbs before they brought him out of it, so he wouldn't wake up a quadraplegic. He'll be partially cyberised, but he'll be whole... physicially anyway."

"Oh... And what's your deal, Ring. Why are you so worried about this guy?"

She raises the still-burned stump of her right arm. "I'm next."

"OH! JESUS! Fuck! Shit!"

"Yeah, I said much the same when I found out..." she trails off, and looks down at the other corner of the room. "Katina... You're friends with that Nate person, aren't you?"

"Yeah..."

"She said... that she died in the Earth Cradle, but her Cell-things, they revived her from brain-death. Right?"

"Y-yeah, that's about right..."

"...I... I need to know... could it work again? On... Jayce?"

"Oh... I'd forgotten, Dumi said it but I'd been so preoccupied with... Arado..."

Ring looks at you, slightly hurt.

"I... I'll go talk with people. Don't worry Ring, if theres something I can do, I will!"

You rush out to find a safe place to talk.

"Dumi! Come in, we need to talk about Jayce!!"

*Oh yes, Mr. Starlord. Rather bad mauling his body took. I was too busy shielding the Trilobites, and Tis was flanking the SRX... I'll assume you'll want him revived.*

"Yes! Wait... Can we? Will it work again?"

*Dr. Nates revival was... a unique set of circumstances, possibly mainly due to the circumstances of her death. She died from shock, due to the extreme pain of... well, hacing her skin flash-fried off by the blast of an MAPW. Her brain and major organs were intact, thanks to the blast sterilising her environment and keeping it airtight.*

"And... that doesn't apply to Jayce?"

*His brain is... mostly intact, but the rest of his body has been alternately crushed and shredded by the shrapnel of his cockpit popping under the overpressure. If we were to introduce False Cells into his body now, I think they'd basically shrug and give up. Though I could convince them to extract his personality patterns and memory, so you'd at least have a simulacrum of his mind.*

"Oh..."

*There are other options however. First is the one currently underway: The body is being prepped for a special cyberisation process, the same one which created Lamia and Echidna. Given its results so far, I'd say that by tomorrow, you'll have Jayce... or at least, something that looks like him.*

"How do you mean? They'll... change his brain?"

*Indeed. Most of the processing and personality centres of Lamia and Echidnas brain have been entirely replaced with computer components. Their identities before their revival as W-series is entirely lost, assuming they weren't simply made from vat-grown parts. Jayce would suffer a similar fate, no doubt Ms Browning would establish an entirely new personality for him.*

"Fuck... that... that bitch! That'd... kill Ring!"

*There is the third, risky option. We do both.*

"...We use the machine cells to save a copy of Jayces brain, then when Lemon fixes his body, we reboot him with the real Jayces brain!"

*Exactly. However, of course, there are downsides.*

"Like what?"

*Well for one, we'd be commiting an act of sabotage against the second-in-command of the entire Shadow Mirror.*

"Er.."

*And, if I may be so blunt, that last time I did this, the results weren't... as helpful as I'd hoped.*

"Huh?"

*Arado.*

"...Oh... Oh! You did that? I thought he just... woke up!"

*It's complicated... But you have to agree, since his revival, Arado hasn't been the most... stable.*

---

The medical ward is a little busier when you re-emerge. A new patient is being lowered into Ryoto's bed, a red-haired young man sporting artificial limbs. Kai and Kar-Wai are helping the ordelies with him, while Kusuha and another nurse help Ring onto a trolley.

"Wait! Kusuha, I need to have a word with Ring in private. Please, just two minutes!"

"Er, the cybernetics equipment is waiting, delaying the procedure isn't-"

Ring raises a stump to quiet her, then lowers it sheepisly. "I'll try to make it quick." The nurses back off for a moment, and Ring turns to you and whispers. "What did you find out?"

"Jayce isn't in the right condition to be brought back the same way as Sophia. We have the option of recovering his brain patterns, or of letting Lemon and Echidna fix his body, but they'll probably mess with his brain, and he won't be Jayce anymore. If we do both, Lemon will probably have our asses for sabotaging her cyborgs. It's your desicion, Ring."

She goes silent for a moment. "...I just feel so selfish right now..."

"Huh?"

"I want him back. I'd give my other hand just to see him standing there, giving a snide comment or trying not to look bored when people talk science... I don't know, maybe its just the painkillers, or the stress, or the fact that it was just so sudden and I didn't see it, I was blinded by the blast and they just told me he was dead later...But right now, I want him back. Thats... thats all I know."

A tear rolls down her cheek as she settles on the trolley. Kusuha and the other nurse wheel her into the operating theatre. You're left alone, watching Irm chat with his father and Kai whispering to a groggy Hugo.

---

You burst into the W-series lab with the jar in your hands.

Lemon spins around. "Tarask! What in god's name-!?"

"Lemon, I thought about sneaking in the Cells. Just pour them in while you worked, and fix Jayces brain, but I thought you'd notice it. I also thought I'd just use them to copy his brain, get out and change his personality back later, but you'd already started and it was too late. So I left with diplomacy, not my strong point, but I'll give you a chance..."

You hold out the jar of grey liquid. "Sophia and Dumi already programmed them. Just... put them into Jayces brain, while you fix his body. Then, at the end, both will be intact. It's the best of both worlds, right?"

Lemon looks at you, her face troubled. She shakes her head at Echidna, who reholsters the pistol she had half-drawn. She then turns back to you. "So it was you who sabotaged W-BC-01, you precious Arado... Did you get him back?"

"Huh?"

"Is he still Arado, Katina? Is he your friend, or some puppet with a false brain, a doll with no real features?"

"...He's angry, and confused, and doesn't know what he's doing, but that could just be from... the way he died. Or just him being Arado really."

Lemon turns away, and leans on the operating table, where the cloth covers the squashed remains. "...It's certainly odd... to find your lifes work has been obsoleted in one fell swoop."

"Huh?"

"I created the W-series because I learned, at a young age, that certain things were impossible. A person who was dead... couldn't be brought back, even with the greatest of medical sciences. You could rebuild a man, take his brain and put it into a new body of metal. You could make a false brain and put it in a bosy of flesh. But the dead... were dead. The vital elements of the brain died too quickly to be saved. They had to be replaced. You could save the intelligence, the imagination, the potential, but what was before was wiped away. You couldn't save the dead. You had to make a new person, and move on."

She turns back to you. To your surprise, she's crying. "Alright, Tarask. Show me that these cells can do the impossible. Bring the dead back to life with me, and I'll let this slide."

You pump your fist. "Yay!"

"But if this fails, I swear to all the gods in hell that you'll pay for tricking me!"

"...yay?"

---

"Mina! Pull out of it! Use your front boosters, stabilise her!"

"I... I can't! The booster system's not responding. The whole thinks flooded with mech-fluid."

Closer, the Gespenst-R edges closer. You're breaking up from slipstream, but you gotta reach the Raubtier, gotte untangle her before she hits the ground

Ring's voice on the comm. "Jayce, we've isolated the problem. Cut the secondary transformation spar on the upper right torso. Mina, at the same time you'll have to reverse the transformation circuit and revert to PT mode. The timing will be tight, real tight, but its the only way.

You pull out the Plasma Cutter. "I'm ready."

"...I beleive in Jayce."

Ring nods. "Ok... Three! Two! One! NOW!!!"

You slice the spar and the tangled mess springs apart, forming into a humanoid shape. It slides along the ground, but comes to a standing stop.

Theres cheering in the Mao Industries tech room. You land the R beside the Raubtier. "That was quite an adventure, wasn't it?"

"Y-yeah. Not quite Sherlock Holmes, bu-"

The after-accident report showed that in addition to the secondary transformation spar fusing, the primary magnetic driver on the port side has twisted into the primary fuel line, and shortcircuited, causing an extreme heat buildup. In the confined space, the fuel had superheated throughout the mech, igniting both it and the hydraulic system.

Picking yourself up and seeing the wreck of the WildRaubtier L in flames, you remember being completely silent, the only noise being Ring's sobs on the comm, and the crackle of flame.

Then you start breathing again.

---

Echidna manipulates the controls. "Pulmonary system active."

Lemon stands beside you. Her face is a mask once more. "Cardiovascular?"

"Active."

"Bring brainwave stimulation to maximum."

"Understood... Activity in all sections detected."

"Alright, Tarask, its make or break time. Let's see if this is reall-"

The corpse leaps up, screaming.

"MMIIIIIINNNNAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!"

---

*I'm afraid, in retrospect, that we've made a horrible mistake.*

You twiddle your earpiece as you continue to hold the sobbing Jayce in your arms. "What? He's alive, isn't he?"

*Not you and me, me and Tis. We took shortcuts we shouldn't have, for an objective that we didn't need to follow, and now, people are suffering for it.*

"What do you mean? You're still doing it, you still so fucking obtuse-"

*We created the False Cells on a whim, because I thought... I needed Arado. He had the same power of psionic distruption that you did, to a much lesser degree. I was getting desperate trying to convince you to come with me to the Neviim, so I decided to look into alternatives. He was the only one, and as a bonus, he knew you, so I figured he could convince you to come along with us. But he was essentially dead, and I needed someone who could move and talk. Then Tis recalled the Earth Cradle, which she'd found on a previous scouting mission. Knowing we would likely be heading there, I sent her to investigate the technology there, to see if it could be used to help Arado.*

"Oh... But it worked, right?"

*We couldn't get them to activate, even a little. I used my Crosstime Correspondence Driver, desperately seeking alternate versions of the cells for guidelines, but the essential element was missing. You'd already arrived in Africa, so I had to compromise. I gave Tis specifications for a prototype system, one I'd never actually used myself, which could turn negative emotions into usable energy.*

"And then it worked?"

*No, it didn't. Not until Tis amplified the effect and made it empathically sympathetic, and self-feeding.*

"..What? Self-feeding? How?"

*Katina... Believe me, I didn't realise this until I saw Jayce's reaction... the False Cells don't just feed on despair... given the oppurtunity, they'll actively cause it. Jayce's sorrow, Arado's anger, they're not just traumatic flashbacks, they're being artificially induced by the Cells which revived them, in order to maintain the needed regenerative energy. Their pain is part of the process keeping them alive.*

"Whu... bu... They'll get over it, won't they?"

*No, Katina. They won't. The False Cells will kill them before they ever recover. We've essentially trapped Arado and Jayce in a fugue state, forcing them to constantly dwell on their own worst memories, pushing them into the pits of despair, just so they can live, in agony...*

You bite your knuckle. "Oh god..."

*Arado... can take it, to a certain extent. His School Training meant he was constantly under high levels of stress and mental manipulation anyway. Jayce, on the other hand, is a healthy young man who's only had a few bad things happen in his life, and dealt with them by trying to move on and forget them. Hence why he's just cried himself to sleep while suckling on your boob.*

You look down and see the wet patch on your dress. "Oh, thats what that was..."

---

"M-miss Lemon... I don't think the Machine Cells... are stable yet."

Lemon looks at you. Her lips are smiling, as if she's just won a great victory. Her eyes are full of loss, as if you'd sucked all the joy from her soul.

"So it would seem... Useless, in the end. Miraculous, but useless."

"We... We can't let them be used in their current state. We have to destroy the batch we have now... and then produce the proper kind."

"Do we now... And how long will that take, pray tell?"

"Ugh... I don't... I'm not a scientist..."

"Then would you kindly explain why you're intruding on scientific affairs??" The smile and the sad eyes are still there, but now her body is shaking with rage. "If you didn't know they were so... so useless to me, why did you ruin my samples with them? Who gave you the right!??!"

"Please, Lemon, I-I just-"

"You just wanted your boyfriend back! You and every other forlorn young woman waiting for their man to come back from war. Do you truly think you're unique, Tarask? That you can break the rules because you're special? Is that it?"

"SHUT UP!! It's not about just me, its what'll happen if we use those cells. We'll end up with a horde of tortured people, who'll kill just do they can live. They'll spread fear, and anguish all across the world, just to do it!"

Another tear down her face. "Those sound like...perfect soldiers."

"Lemon, you gotta-"

"MISS BROWNING to the likes of you!"

"...You have to stop Vindel from using them. He won't listen to me. He'll start putting them into dead soldiers, mechs, everything, and they'll create an army, an awesome, terrible army that'll never stop. Even when Vindel has had his fill of bloodshed, they won't stop."

*That's an extreme extrapolation from the facts at hand, Katina... But I can't deny that it isn't a possibility.*

Lemon looks up at the nearby comm panel, and the Diamond Eye thats appearred on it. "No respect for security protocols... You said yesterday this was a simple psychic resonance effect, that the current cells simply responded better when human brainwaves were present. Now you're implying that they actively induce emotions."

*As Katina said, they're incomplete. Unstable. Its an unintended sideeffect of our rush to finish them.*

"What if you put them in mechs? Would they still have the effects you describe?"

*...Not initially. So long as the mech didn't have a pilot support program or a takeover autopilot, they shouldn't be able to influence a pilot. Adding the likes of the GEIM system would be disastrous, however. And... if a particular mech became too infamous, if it had been the killer of hundreds, and people ran in fear at the very mention of its name... Theres a chance the Cells could use the psychic resonance to self-evolve.*

Lemon struts across the room. "Let's be realistic here. We're not going to have an alternative for Vindel in the next while. Even together, we can't analyse all this alien technology that quickly. Vindel will want what we have now. So what we must do... is treat the current load of Cells as a dangerous substance, but one we can use in controlled areas. They'll be placed in standard mechs to improve performance."

*An adequate compromise solution. I'll begin work on a self-destruct sequence that will prevent the Cells from becoming too widespread in any one piece of equipment.*

"And Ms Tarask will be confined to quarters for her gross insubordination."

"What? You're trying to pin this on me? What the hell, lady?"

"I suppose I should take some of the blame, letting you ruin W-19 like that, but I'll just have to call it a moment of weakness."

"He's not ruined! He's just really emo!"

"He's meant to be a perfect artificial human. This is a piece of human detritus, a ruin of a person that can barely function. And we have enough of those stinking up this ship already."

She gestured from Echidna to you. "Take her away. One weeks confinement, subject to renewal."

---

You scowl as Echidna escorts you to your quarters. As the two of you march through the ship, faces turn and stare at you, face looking at the floor. People start to whisper, shocked that you've finally gotten your comeuppance. One guy cheers.

Echidna leads you to the door, and sets it to lock with her keycard. "I'll arrange a meal schedule for you. Ms Browning said nothing about taking away comm privledges, so you may retain your commlink."

"Any chance of getting internet access? I'll be cooped up for a week, I'll need to keep myself enteratined."

"Unlikely."

"I only need access to Underagewhores.ru, come on."

Echidna opens the door, jostles you inside, and closes it behind her.

You stare at the door, hoping your eyelasers will burn through, but once again they fail to make a mark.

Then theres a rattle behind you. Your closet opens.

"Hi. I... heard you were feeling down..."

You run to Arado and hug him tightly. You start to sniffle as he returns the hug. Then you bury your face in his shoulder and start to bawl.

Time passes. You blink the tears away, and find you're on the bed. Arado still has his arms around you, and his legs to, and he's nuzzling at the base of your neck, while one hand fiddles at the ribbons of your dress.

"Oh, Kat, just say the word..."
