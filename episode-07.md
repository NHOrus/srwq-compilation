# Episode 07

##SRWQ Mission 7: Maybe you'll finally get to relax for a bit. But I doubt it.

**_The Setup:_** You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask, trained by the School to wear pretty dresses and fly robots. The heroes of the OGverse has come to the Shadow Mirror universe to stop the Lygeus/Acguies system from giving Dark Brain another chance to destroy their world. This is a conflict of interest.

**_So Far:_** You managed to escape from the Tesla-Liecht Institute, but were pursued by some of the OG guys. With the help of a very helpful AI called Dumi and the 3rd and 4th Dynamic General Guardians, you managed to fight them to a standstill and capture Arado Balanga. However, the Shadow Mirror Arado was an old crush and the victim of one of the more controversial of your rage-killings, so his presence confused and angered you. A hilarious chain of events caused the destruction of one of your teams ships, the loss of several (admittedly damaged) mechs, and Dumi having to fast-talk like crazy to convince the team your crazy behavior was due to your brain attempting to undo the Schools brainwashing. Except you're not sure if he was actually lying about that part.

####Current complement for Reference.

+ You.
+ Irmgard Kazahara, supposedly team leader. Hasn't done any leading since you joined.
+ Russel Bagman, irish rugby and boxing champ, Shadow Mirror spy, and the only person other than Dumi who hasn't complained about your mad schemes.
+ Latooni Subota: Cold, calculating graduate of the School with a big superiority complex. Still hasn't put out.
+ Ibis Douglas: Gun nut and artillery specialist, still pining for her missing friend. You've befriended her, but offers of comfort sex have been rebuffed so far.
+ Johnathan Kazahara: Main engineer on the now-obsolete Grungust line, and probably the last surviving scientist from TLI.
+ Rio Mei Long: Engineer and pilot, good at multitasking, enough to keep a Trilobite battleship meant to have a crew of dozens flying single-handedly.
+ Ryoto Hikawa: Your designated punch bag for the trip. Has yet to do a single useful thing yet except hold things for Johnathan and Rio.
+ Arado Balanga: Your prisoner, though you haven't gotten alone time with him yet. Part of you is still convinced he's the ghost of your dead friend returned from hell to punish you for your sins, but the sense-making part of your brain is winning for now.
+ Kai Kitamura: When last you heard of Magnum Kitamura, he had left his job training EFA recruits to help spearhead the assault on the Inspectors final fortress. Three months later he appears in a Shadow Mirror battleship sporting an eyepatch and asking politely if he can help. No-one is sure what to make of him, but he's so experienced and smexy that he's practically team leader at this point, even though you can't tell if he's even on your side.
+ Dumi-chan: The Dynamic Unlimited Military Intelligence, an AI meant to run the DGG-04 and support the Raioh. Has bent over backwards to help you out of many sticky situations, claiming that as the DGG-03's registered pilot, keeping you alive is its top priority.

####Your Mecha:

+ Blue Gespenst: Currently assigned to Russel. Its arms have finally been reattached after the encounter with Ryusei.
+ Red Gespenst: Currently assigned to Ibis, whose friend Sleigh used it before she apparently abandoned the Shadow Mirrors for some unknown purpose.
+ Assault Lander: A tank-like mobile unit derived from the Grungust series. As the Grungust series have pretty much been scrapped to use their Clacker engines to power the Lygeus, this may be the last usable example of Johnathan's work.
+ DGG-XAM-03 Raioh: A new super robot built using DC technology. Meant for kicking things till they explode from it. Contains something called the LIOH system, which Dumi says he used to analyze you.
+ DGG-XAM-04: An as-yet unnamed fire support super robot, which transforms into a motorbike for the Raioh. Its cockpit block is sealed: Apparently its been replaced with all of Dumi's systems.
+ Trilobite battleship: An attempt by the Shadow Mirror to answer the threat of the EFAs Space Noah class battleships, the Trilobite is possibly the best stealth insertion cruiser on the planet, able to transport a full complement of PTs across the planet in less than 24 hours without being detected. However, you have a total of 11 people and one AI to run the damned thing, so right now, its a faster, better-armored Tausendfuessler.

Kai Kitamura removes the restraints from the isolation bed and stands back as you get up.
"Ok miss, we're finally landed at DC California. You get to walk about, but I hope you don't mind if we keep you from going off alone, or being around sharp objects."

You rub at your eyes, trying to feign the effects of the nonexistent sedation that Dumi told the other he'd given you.
"Fine, whatever. We need to sit down and figure out what we're doing."

"Definitely. But its going to be a group decision, alright?"

You shrug. "If the group just so happens to agree with me completely, theres nothing wrong with that."

Kai stares after you as you leave the medbay.

---

As you walk onto the hangar deck, Rio gasps, Irm cringes, Johnathan grimaces and Ryoto makes a run for the bridge.

"Soooo..." Irm begins. "Feeling better?"

"Much. Thank you." You're feeling sort of moe right now, which still manages to put Irm at ease even though he should realize by now how quickly and extremely your mood can change.

"That's great! You can help move our mechs out onto the field. I for one am sick of being cooped up in a flying tincan."

When Irm said to put the mechs onto the field, you thought he'd meant an airfield, but once you exit the Trilobite, you see that no, he actually meant a field, covered with grass and the occasional orange tree. You'd heard that the DC's one remaining large base was a joke, but you were expecting a little more than a couple of rusting warehouses in the middle of Orange County. The only visible sign this is a military base are a half-dozen Lion Fs standing idle on the one patch of concrete visible. It's little wonder the EFA hasn't bothered to attack them.

"Hrrmm... maybe expecting to find a brain doctor was asking a bit much." muses Kai.

A stern-looking woman with a zipped-down flightsuit walks up to your group and salutes half-heartedly. "Major Heinkel, Military Commander of California Base. I wasn't aware the Shadow Mirrors even remembered we existed."

"Er... Lt. Kazahara. Ugh, I realise our arrival is a little unexpected but we-"

"Save it, Lieutenant. If I was being allowed to have a real discussion with you, they'd be able to hear me at Langley. I'm just an escort. You're going to have a chat with the Commander-in-Chief."

Heinkel leads you, Irm, Kai, Latooni and Johnathan across the grass without another word. The tension is unbearable, so you step to the back of the group and whisper to Latooni. "Ok Subota, you're the big brainbox. Should we know is this bitch?"

"Julia Heinkel, commander of Troye Unit, the United Colony Corps former ace squadron, before the EFA crackdown. All women. Reappeared in Maier Branstein Brigade when the colonies formed the DC Space Forces, major players in the Double Drop Incident. They were believed wiped out during Operation Wolfpack."

"Probably the best troops the DC has left.", remarks Kai.

You look around as you walk past the parked Lions, and you do indeed see several young women hanging around the base, their features marking them as spacenoids. You notice one particularly ravishing specimen, her long blond hair shielding most of her face, talking to a boy of similar age wearing a bandana. Your gaze lingers a while, before Latooni drags you by a ribbon to catch back up to the group.

You reach the side door of what looks like a country villa, which is more appropriate to the terrain but in no better condition than the warehouses. Heinkel opens the door and then begins to walk off. "In there, up the stairs, office is on the left. Have fun. She certainly will."

"The surviving commander in chief of the Neo-DC..." Irm muses as he climbs the stairs. "You'd think someone like that would be somewhere less public."

"Could be its a decoy, or that they want to go semi-legit in the near future." say Kai.

But you're not really listening because Latooni has finally let her guard down.

"Ngh!" She tries to keep quiet as you pull off the ribbon holding her collar closed.

"If you want this back," you whisper, "you'll have to come to my room later."

She glares at you over her glasses as you head on up the stairs, making a visible effort not to turn bright red.

---

"Greetings, Ma'am, I'm Lt. Kazahara of the Tesla Lei-"

"Oh aren't you two just adorable!!"

Irm is slightly taken aback as the young woman strides past him and Kai and goes up to you and Latooni, hands clasped in barely contained glee.

"I'd always heard they were putting the School students in the nicest little dresses, but I didn't think they'd be like this! Ribbons everywhere!! All the edges are frilly. Oh I could just pinch your cheeks right now..."

Kai coughs to regain the initiative in the conversation. "Miss Zoldark, as interesting as the EFA elite pilots dress code may be, I think we have more pressing concerns."

Irm and Johnathan go goggle-eyed. "Zoldark??! And in, Bian Zoldark??"

The girl, you'd say no more than 18, loses the ecstatic expression on her face and stand up straight. "My father was well-known for his long-term planning, and I was no exception. I was training to replace him as head of the Divine Crusaders almost as soon as he began putting them together."

"But he didn't plan for you to have so little to work with, did he?"

"You'd be surprised what I've done with so little, Mr Kitamura. And might I say, that eyepatch looks quite... evocative on you."

"Thanks. I'll remember that the next I have flashbacks to my eye being torn out by shrapnel."

"Enough about Kai's sexy eyepatch!! Miss Zoldark, the Shadow Mirrors... we... we might be most of whats left of them..."

"Hmm, that sounds a little odd."

"Odd? ODD?"

"Well, from what we gathered from our sources, the EFA has sent the Shirogane and 15 supplementary PT platoons to assault the Tesla-Liecht Institute. Other sources indicated that the Shadow Mirrors had concentrated virtually their entire force there for unclear reasons. The logical outcome would have been that the Beowulves would have attacked your main forces, been repulsed, and then a second wave would be called from Langley and from orbit to finish the job before you could escape."

Irm blinks. "Those are... some very good sources."

"And a interesting deduction of the facts on the surface." remarks Kai.

Ryuune just shrugs.

"But it wasn't the EFA!" You say. "It was the new guys, they appeared out of the portal and our forces were crushed! They said they came in peace, but their landing here killed almost all of the Shadow Mirrors!"

Ryuune looks at you quizzically, then at Kai. "A portal, you say? As in, some sort of teleportation?"

Irm nods. "We captured one of them, and he claimed they were from a dimension parallel to ours, and something on our world was threatening theirs."

Ryuune looks pensive for a second, then goes back to her desk, and begins pressing buttons on a terminal.

"I'd like to meet this prisoner of yours, in our medical center downstairs. We're going to need some specialized equipment, to check whether he's really human or not."

"R-right, but we'll have to check on him as you're doing it, to make sure he's... treated properly."

You don't think Ryuune sees Irm facepalming.

"And... he has to be whole afterwards. He's m-... our prisoner."

"Well, as long as he's not an alien, there shouldn't need to be any autopsy..."

The remains of the Wuerger are lifted out of the Trilobite by crane, and brought to a nearby warehouse, while Arado, still bandaged, is taken to the medical centre.

"Please, Ryuune! If you're anything like our Ryuune, you have to... well ok, you're probably not like our Ryuune, since you're not wearing those lovely cutoffs, but still..."

"I only wear my cutoffs on special occasions. Now, you're from another world, correct?"

"Y-yeah, I told the Kai and the Irm and-"

"What Solar System is that world in?"

It takes about 5 seconds for Arado to work out what Ryuune is saying. "Oh no!! Not like another planet world, a dimension world. We're from another earth and... OH GOD! It's her! Keep her away!!!" Arado squirms in the restraints as you come over with antiseptic and fresh bandages.

"Don't worry, Arado-kun. I'm just going to clean that little accident. Once Nurse Tarask is finished, it'll be like there never was a cut at all. There'll only be the tiniest of scars..."

You lean in close and whisper in his ear.

"...To mark you as *mine."*

Ryuune continues her questions as she and the DC scientists adjust a varied and bewildering array of machines.

"A Mirror dimension, based on ours?"

"Yeah! Well, not based on yours, it's just that there are similarities, and-"

"Who made it?"

"..No no no, its, y'know, natural. Or something. It's just the way that the universe is, that there's more than one, I guess."

"And why did you transport to our universe?"

"Ok, I realise that this might not be easy to take..." He looks nervously at you again, "But our dimension was attacked by a being called Dark Brain. We saw him off but he's still able to damage our dimension. People are disappearing all over the world, and the only way t-"

"What kind of weapon is he using?"

"Ah... I don't know! Why are asking these weird questions??"

"Well, part of the reason is the cute faces you keep making..."

"Aw, gee, shucks..."

"But the main reason is that you're the type of enemy that the DC was meant to fight. You're an entity not of this earth. You're an alien invader."

The expression on Arado's face is a mix of total confusion and total terror. It is kinda cute.

"...At least, from a certain point of view."

Arado shakes his head. "Look, we're not here to stay or anything! This is just a temporary thing, we need to remove all traces of interdimensional technology from your world, so that Dark Brain can't find our dimension using yours. It's like, two pieces of Shadow Mirror technology. Melt them down and we're gone."

"I see." Ryuune looks around the room, seeming to focus on your group. "Well, our apparatus are set up, so we'll leave you alone with the detectors and probes now. You're wearing lead underwear, right?"

"Huh?"

"Bu-bye, see you in a tick-tick-tick."

Ryuune beckons you into the next room.

"Uh... he'll be alright, won't he?"

"A healthy young boy like that? He'll be fine. But more importantly, it seems he's telling the truth, because his story has basically no use as a lie."

Kai grunts. "True enough, but what does it mean?"

"Well, if it is all true, then these new forces are only going to be here a certain length of time, until they get what they've come for. Apparently, that only includes your prototype devices, which they may already have destroyed."

Irm nods. "So, that's that? We just give them back their soldier, and they can leave? So long Shadow Mirror, just like that?"

Ryuune raises a finger. "Hardly. If this so-called threat to their world is as great as they believe, they can't take any chances. They have to make sure they have every last scrap of that technology, every blueprint, every file on every computer, anything that even resembles the tech if you squint. Otherwise, all that'll happen is a few years from now, someone will make it again. That'll be an awful big pile of bodies, before they're through."

Irm starts going pale. "But... we don't have any of the System XN technology! We have a couple of experimental mechs, that's all!!"

"They can't take your word for it. They have to be sure, which means either they come to find you, or you go to them. Assuming you can, of course."

Irm looks puzzled at this, but Kai perks up. "The EFA have the whole of TLI surrounded, don't they?"

Ryuune smirked. "Based on what we've been receiving in the past hour, they have most of the Central United States surrounded. There's a massive jamming zone covering 4 states being established by their satellites, which is playing havoc with comms all across the country. Plus we have it on good authority that Langley base is on full alert, and that several EFA ships are making re-entries in the region. You're not going to get back to TLI the normal way."

Irm is looking increasingly confused at all of this. "So... if there's such a big cordon around them... What are we going to worry about? We can't get to them, they can't get to us... we're in the clear, right?"

Latooni breaks in. "In their current strategic position, a competent military force will not remain surrounded by the enemy. The Newcomers will attempt to break through the EFA cordon, probably this very night, destroying TLI to cover their tracks. If they are powerful enough, they'll make an all-out assault and break the cordon, otherwise a system of diversionary attack can be used to open up the EFA lines to sneak their troops out. Then in most likelihood they will scatter their forces, to prevent them being pinned in a similar fashion again."

Ryuune claps lightly. "Very good, Miss Subota. If I had a ribbon to reward you, I'd give you one."

Latooni turns slightly red at the mention of ribbons.

"Is... Are you done with Arado yet??"

Ryuune smiles. "You know, you're awfully attached to that young boy, given that you met him a few hours ago while he was trying to capture you."

"I-i-its not like I'm... or anything to with him!! I'm just concerned, he's our valuable special prisoner!"

Ryuune giggles. "Well, alright then. The results say he's 100% human, so you can unstrap him if you like."

You rush into the room teary-eyed.

"Thank god that's oveOH GOD GET HER AWAY!!!" screams Arado.

"Arado-kuuun, I'm so sorry!" You sob as you bury his face in your chest "They hurt me, Arado, they broke my brain, and its trying to fix itself but it won't go back all the way. So when I say mean things or try to hurt you, its not because I really mean it. Beleive me, Arado-kun!"

"...dish ish both terrifying andsh incredibly hot at the shame time."

"I'll keep you safe from the crazy radiation lady Arado. We'll be friends, just like before, and we'll put the silly past behind it and go forth and slay all who oppose us."

"...It'sh really warm in here..."

"..."

"..."

"Why aren't you chewing on my nipples?"

"I'D LIKE TO BE LET OUT NOW!"

####Meanwhile:

Ryuune takes the more sensible members of the team into her office again. "If we assume the Newcomers will break out of the EFA cordon, then you and any place you stay is potentially at risk. Ultimately, you have to 'clear' yourselves with these people, or forever remain targets. That means you have to meet them."

Irm nods in understanding for once. "Given how enthusiastic you're looking, I'd say you're looking forward to that meeting."

"Oh, does it show?"

Kai strokes his mustache. "The appearance of the Newcomers introduces a rogue element into the fragile structure of Earth Sphere politics. Already, they've decimated one of the most important non-EFA factions, practically by accident. Even if their presence is only temporary, the shakeup will cause massive repercussions across the Earth Sphere."

Irm frowns. "How massive, exactly?"

"You're practically a civilian, Kazahara. You don't have even an inkling of whats going on in the heart of the EFA. I caught a glimpse, and I lost my eye over it. But it was enough to figure out that theres a major divide forming in the EFA, and the Federation as a whole."

Irm's eyes go wide. "Civil war... All this time, it was what the Shadow Mirror hoped for, but to actually think this small group could do it..."

Ryuune sits down at her desk "The chance, even the smallest glimmer, we have to take, else we'll rot here until the EFA finally decide to finish us off. Comms are getting more and more difficult, but with our contacts we should be able to track at least one of the Newcomer groups, and make friendly conta-"

A beeping from her desk communicator. "Yes. What? Two of them? Right away!!"

"Scratch that, we won't be needing to find them. They've already arrived."

---

Your alone time with Arado is rudely broken by a deployment alarm and a call from Irm to get to your mech. Leaving Arado with Kai, you head out to the Trilobite as the Lions begin to take off.

Dumi is already active and lifts you gently into the cockpit of the Raioh, as Russel and Ibis warm up their Gespensts. Coming over the crest of a hearby hill, you see the two intruders: Super Robots of very similar design to your mech, one decorated like a samurai, the other with a mane of white hair and a cloak billowing around it.

One of them turns on a loudspeaker and talks out over the base. "I am Ratsel Fienschmecker, and this is my companion, Sanger Zonvolt. May we speak to the person in charge of this base?"

Ryuune's voice sounds over another loudspeaker from somewhere in the facility. "Greetings Sirs. Am I to take it that you are some of the Newcomers who arrived at TLI today?"

"...That would be accurate, Miss Zoldark."

"Even knowing my name is enough for me to believe you. You may dismount and meet with me in the Main House. I ensure your safety."

The two mechs start to walk over to the house. As they go, you activate the comm. "Dumi, what are those mechs?"

Comparisons with my database imply they are completed versions of the Dynamic General Guardians units 1 and 2. In our universe, they were never fully completed, not only due to the Neo DC's lack of resources, but because no available pilots were capable of handling the simulated output. The project was delayed and eventually fell into the hands of the Shadow Mirrors, who dismantled the frames and started fresh, eventually recreating them as units 3 and 4. The Lioh system and I were developed to allow pilots to handle the units.

You nod as you zoom your cameras into the two impressive men walking into Ryuunes mansion.

"And who are they?"

*No data. My database of human faces has many entries but far from complete. It may be they have no counterparts of note in this universe.*

"...Are we just going to sit here while they talk?"

*It would appear only Lt Irm and Captain Kai are going to be present at their meeting. However, I may be able to eavesdrop on them. Would you like to?*

"N-No! It's not like I care what old people like that are talking about anyway. I'll find something else to do!

*You key into the Shadow Mirror comms frequency. It's been a while since you properly talked to Ibis and Russel.*

"So, Ibis, Bags, what do you make of all this?"

Russel's irish brogue is quite comforting to hear. "Well as can be expected, I s'pose. 'tis a sore loss to have all the work ye've done over the past few years come to nought though. Without the Mirrors to kick the EFA in the bollocks once in a while, the worlds going to be a dreary place. It'll be like that Orwell novel, wha's the one...?"

"Big Brother?"

"No! That's a TV show about a bunch of eejits being locked in a house until they start shagging each other."

"Ibis, what do you think?"

"...Huh?"

"About all thats happened. Aren't you sad that the Shadow Mirrors are gone?"

"...Don't hate me for saying this, but I really only joined because Sleigh did."

"Really? Man, you're really dedicated to tracking your friend."

"She's more than a friend, we're practically sisters. Filio raised us together, taught us all we know, we've been together for years. But a few years ago, she got really restless. She was fed up with the way the EFA was doing things, said that the world was 'running out of justice'. She convinced Filio to stay in the EOTI even though he didn't want to be part of a war, and became one of their pilots. I stayed too, to keep an eye on her, but we were assigned to seperate squads. When the DC were beaten, I lost her for ages before I heard of all the ex-DC joining the Shadow Mirror. I got to TLI a month ago, and everyone said she was there, but I never found a trace of her other than the message in her Gespenst."

---

####Meanwhile:

SURVIELLANCE MODE ACTIVE

LASER ATTUNED TO WINDOW VIBRATIONS

"-lcome to the Neo DC California base, Mr Fienschmecker. Please excuse the decor, the furniture is taken from an old farm down the road."

"It's quite alright. It reminds me of the stable I used to own."

"The DC codes you signalled us with were rather old, but accurate. Given your background, would I be right in suggesting you're affiliated with... a nother DC faction?"

"Both Sanger and I served directly under the Bian Zoldark of our universe. We fought for his ideals, and when the DC was defeated, we followed his dying wish and brought those ideals to the new champions of Earth, and fought with them against many threats to humanity."

"I... see. We could have done with more people like that here. But enough reminiscing: Why exactly are you here?"

REPEAT INFORMATION DETECTED. APPLYING AUTONOTICE FOR NEW INFORMATION.

---

"Would you like to go find her?"

Ibis jumps in her seat at this. "Wh-what?? Really? You think we can do that, at a time like this?"

"Well, I'm just thinking, I need to go somewhere and get a new dress anyway, why not make the trip a little longer to try to find someone?"

"Shopping and searching for missin' people aren't the least bit the same!" Exclaims Russel. "Besides, we're still under Irm's command, we can't just go running off, with this big fight going on!"

"It was just an idea, Russel. No need to bite my head off."

"Well, we'll see when we'll see. We're going to have to figure out somethin' t'do with our lives now that the Shadow Mirrors are gone. Finding a lost woman wouldn't be the worst thing to be doing, assuming the EFA don't hunt us all down like dogs."

---

####SURVEILLANCE CONTINUES

"So you need to find these two pieces of Shadow Mirror technology, and that's that?"

"That, and a potential third target. Dark Brain wouldn't have found the channel to our world unless one of his servants were here in this world to detect it. Even if the current systems were completely gone, there's still a chance it could find its the path. We intend to make sure that doesn't happen."

"This servant... is it human?"

"We can't be sure, but the version we faced in our world had the ability to create artificial humanoid servants. Dark Brains technology was incredibly advanced, there's no telling what form it might take."

"Sounds like that thing would be hard to track down."

"We have a tendency to attract that sort of attention..."

"So, to summarize, you need our help to track down Vindel Mauser and this 'Servant', as soon as possible, despite the fact they could be anywhere on the planet, or even the Earth Sphere."

"And in exchange, you'll be wanting our help, I assume."

"Well... I'm not sure we can take cheque for Otherworld Dollars, and I don't know if I'd trust you in any form of military alliance, but... lets just say you'll owe us a favor."
