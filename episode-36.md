In our last thread, our heroine had a brief duel with a mysterious First and only warrior called Alfimi, who cheated to get out of Katinas rape-hug and forced Shuu to save our heroine. Reestablishing contact with the base, Katina learned that her allies had been attacked, and hurt. Badly.

As our heroine races to rejoin the group, other forces plot their own nefarious schemes, some to achieve peace and security, others to topple empires and spread bloodshed. Will the planet, nay, the universe, survive this storm?

That wasn't wise, Dr. Shirakawa. Surely you've realised the state of the interdimensional borders, teleporting so many people at once is incredibly dangerous.

"I assure you, 'Dumi', that I've already observed the dimensional interference effect you mention, and compensated for it. The Granzon is now shielded from such disturbances, and can travel safely at will."

With the sideeffect that now I can't scan it at all, where before it was only its core I couldn't scan.

"...Indeed."

The Raioh lands on the blast-plain, and you look out over a vast expanse of what haw once thick rainforest, but is now bare earth. The vegetation has been blasted from the earth for miles around, and the soil ripped away, revealing bare rock in patchs.

The furrow in the earth, marking the centre of the beams path, passes right through the eastern part of the DC base. Little remains except the twisted hulks of two Rhinoceros battleships. The western half of the base has merely been flattened, with the battered but intact Trilobites the only things standing. Wreckage lies everywhere, some of it blown half a mile south by the force of the blast.

"Jesus....where do I start?"

OPTIONS FOR KATINA:
Talk to Irregulars before they leave.
Bump into a certain zombie.
Find Axel.
Talk to Latooni about her 'guest'.
Speak with the medical team about whats happened.
Talk to Irm (and Vindel).
Look for Sophia, Vat Tran and Aquija.
Long conversation with Dumi.
Chase futilely after Kurogane.
Talk to the engineers.

I'm not sure that'd be the wisest idea, considering how she was acting towards Wodan. It's as if she's barely retaining her humanity as it is...

Actually, it seemed she was getting angry at him because he was insisting on calling her Magus, suggesting that she's still Sophia. Furthermore, the other reason for her distress is the same as my reason for wanting to get her the crystals - if you hadn't noticed, we don't have real Machine Cells. Ours don't regenerate endlessly on their own in a duplication of the natural ability of the Zfylud Crystals. Instead, what ours duplicate is Dark Brain's ability to feed off negative emotions, which is why they're so strong after the massacre we were just subjected to. This means two things.

First, it means they're less effective under most circumstances. We rarely have enough power in ours for more than repairs - hardly enough to go about using them for any of our projects.

Second, it means we're tied to Dark Brain in a way that's undesirable at best. I have no doubt that if we go against him, and there are several story routes where we will, suddenly everything we have False Cells in will turn on us. That includes our own mech. Getting away from that ASAP is top priority in my mind.

You step down from the Raiohs hatch into the hangar, circling around the crater left by some sort of energy grenade. Given what happened, the Trilobites hangar is in pretty good shape.

Latooni sit on a bench tapping away at her datapad. "Hey, Subota, how's things with you? It seems you come out of it unscathed."

"Naturally. Enjoy your holiday?"

"It wasn't a holiday! I was working hard, getting us deals with aliens and saving the ELF leader! And kicking ass, I might add. Why, if anything I deserve a holiday after all th-"

"What is Dumi? What is he really?"

You're caught up short by the girls intense gaze.

"He says he's on our side, but he hasn't lifted a wing since we got here. He let the Irregulars claim the Zweizergain, and the only thing he did in the battle was watch and shield the Trilobites from the blast. He won't talk to anyone, only giving Irm the most curt of replies. We can't even be sure thats actually Dumi and not some alien weapon that stole his command codes. Now, explain, Katina."

WHAT WILL YOU SAY TO THE ANGRY LOLI?

Tell her the truth, as much of it as we know. Lat's probably our most trustworthy ally, I think we can tell her all we know about Dumi. Especially if we want a threesome.

Also, bored Couch is in class and therefore bored. Presenting the Latgelmir.

The result of altering an Ashsaber with Machine Cells, the Balder is a machine customized for SM!Latooni's personal use. Taking elements from her preferred combat types, the unit is versatile, armed with a "Viscumalbum" adjustable-range beam rifle which is stored on the back, sliding under the right shoulder when in use. In addition to this, for close and mid-range combat, the unit carries a pair of "Matricaria" sword rifles at its hips, mutated versions of the Ashsaber's Gun Rapier. Normally closed in sword form, the handle swings 45 degrees and the blade splits down the center to reveal the rifle emitter, with the top portion sliding backwards over the hand for bracing and the bottom portion shifting downward to form the handguard. The Sword Breakers have evolved into "Draupnir" remote weapons, possessing greater firepower and the ability to use the unit's own Hyper Jammer so that they appear to duplicate themselves to even greater numbers. Finally, a transformation mode has been added similar to the StealthRaubtier's, providing higher acceleration and dodging capability at the cost of losing access to the Draupnirs, which cannot be deployed as they cannot keep up with the unit's speed.

The overall look of the unit is organic, like all Machine Cell creations. The Draupnirs are docked on the unit's back, unlike the Ashsaber's original shoulder-mounted arrangement, forming part of the wings in bird mode. While transformed, it bears great similarity to a large bird of prey, and can even be ridden by Tis's Belgermir for part of a "Twelve Judgements" combination attack.

"It is Dumi, the same Dumi who's been helping us all this time! It just that, well, he wasn't exactly made on Earth, and he was looking for his real body at the same time he was helping us."

"I see...And now that he has this body, what is he going to do? He hasn't moved since the battle, is he calculating something, recharging, what?"

"I...er...He told me he was trying to find something on this world..."

"So he's an Irregular?"

"Well, not in the same sense, but....kinda..."

Latooni sits up. "It seems to me you need to get some proper answers, Tarask. You're the only one that thing seems to trust, so you'd better sort this out. Oh, and here."

She hands you a keycard. "Cell 3. She doesn't like being touched." With that, she walks off.

"Don't you want to hear about the Aliens? Me kicking ass in China? The Sexy tentacle girl who came onto me?"

Latooni hops into the elevator, the doors closing behind her.

ELSEWHERE.

Vindel watches the end of the file. "Have you shown this to anyone else?"

Irm shakes his head. "No sir, but the Irregulars have their own copy."

"Right. Gather the crew in Trilobite 1 in fifteen minutes. And prepare a holoprojector."

"Dumi? Dumi, I know you can hear me!"

Yes, Katina. How can I help you?

"Dumi...whats gotten into you? Ever since China, you've been out of touch, and not just with me. Latooni said you hadn't tlaked to anyone, and you didn't help the guys fight off the SRX. What are you thinking, Dumi?"

I....I don't...Ok. There's a...storm, coming, from the Endless Frontier. It's wrapping this universe in tendrils of indescribable darkness, making it almost impossible to access other dimensions. My last teleport nearly crippled me, I can't access the components that exist in hyperspace, and even my hyperwave link to my three homonculi is starting to pick up static. I can't tell exactly what caused this storm, but I know its something bad. And....I have the horrible feeling...I may be part of the cause...

"Wha...Dumi, what did you do?"

"I activated my body and started teleporting around. Shuu turned on his Granzon. The Balmarians powered up their Neviim. The Huckebien R exploded. I arrived here. The Shadow Mirrors punched a hole in space, and travelled through it. Then the Irregulars stopped them, turning back time and altering their own reality in the process. Each of these things is like a note in a song, drawing up the snake from the pot, and is weakening the barriers that keep worlds apart. Its a cumulative process, but one that has been building from what we've been doing.[/i]

"So...We called something here? What is it?"

Why does everyone keep asking me that? I! Don't! Know! That's whats freaking me out here! It could be Dark Brain, it could be his retard hillbilly cousin. It could be a demon, or an angel, god or devil. There could one or a billion of them. I can't tell, because the storm blocks everything! The only way to know would be to venture out into it, and see directly...

"And are you going to do that?"

...I don't know if I should...when I can just leave.

"Leave? LEAVE?"

I'm the most dimensionally active entity in this section of space right now, except maybe for that Giest thing of the Irregulars. Whatever comes through that storm, it'll likely look for me first. I-I can't risk it being...him. Any other entity I'd face, at the least, to protect you from it. But if its him, I'm powerless. If I can get the Kaiser, and leave this dimension, I can maybe lead it away, and complete my mission. Your dimension, and I, would be safe.

"B-but....*sniff* Dumiiii, you can't just leave me. You said we'd be partners, didn't you? You wouldn't lie to me about that! You wouldn't!!!"

Katina....I want...I want you to consider, at least...leaving this world, and coming with me.

"What?!?"

I know it would be tough, for a being of only one world like you, to abandon your home and travel the Frontier, but....it's the only way we could stay together. And if we get lucky, we could come back here, perhaps. At least to visit. Maybe...maybe you'd prefer it out there! Yes, the Frontier is a wonderful place, with infinite possibility. I'm sure you'd take to it quite well...

"D-Dumi, I...I don't...You really think this is the only way?"

I....Well....I suppose...Well, I can't...I don't....I don't know. There might be some other way...but I can't think of one. Everytime I try to think around the issue, my primary programming activates, and intrudes on my higher thought functions. Getting the Kaiser and returning to Dark Brain...it's like one of those songs that gets stuck in your head, you know? I can't think of any thing else. If...If you can, think of another way....I'll listen. I can still do that at least."

"W....Well....Um..."

"This is Irm to all Shadow Mirrors. Return to Trilobite 1s hangar immediately. Colonel Mauser has returned, and he has something to show you."

The possibilities are infinite. And besides, we have absolutely no way of beating Dark Brain like we are now. The thing destroys dimensions by just using 10& of it's energy. As we are right now, without gameplay and epic plot armour helping us, defeating Dark Brain is a complete impossibility.

I wish I could have done more, found some way to rejoin you sooner, but finally, thanks to the efforts of Ms Tarask, I can finally rejoin you, and work to put this whole mess right."

Vindel indicates you, and many turn to stare at you, some appprovingly, many in surprise, more than one in abject horror.

"The situation on our planet has changed. When previously, the EFA had backed us into a corner, and forced us to attempt the jump to another world, now many forces are marching, the EFA has been bloodied by your efforts and those of others, and the world has been thrown into chaos. And Chaos, dear friends, is our lifes blood."

"Yesterday, you were attacked by the powerful unit in the EFA today. Thanks to your amazing talents and determination, you survived this encounter with minimal losses, when the DC, the army which once tried to take over the planet, died like dogs. Make no mistake, this is proof of our ability. Proof so obvious, even the enemy has to admit it...Irm, show them the file."

Okay, here's my plan to help Dumi. First, we talk to the irregulars and get as much info on what happened with Dark Brain in their universe as possible. This should get us the fate of Dynamis 3/Duminuss 3 (I.E. Dark Brain blew it up after it summoned him)

Then ask Dumi what priority is placed on its own survival.

If Dumi's survival is prioritized higher than getting the compatikaiser and summoning Dark Brain, then we should be able to override Dumi's compulsion to summon DB.
If it is less, we may need to apply logic to get it to increase the priority. Mainly, that Dumi's mission cannot be accomplished unless Dumi survives, so survival should be a higher priority than obtaining the compatikaiser.

Likewise, summoning Dark Brain without having the compatible kaiser would inflict his wrath and likely cause Dumi's death, preventing the collection of the compatible kaiser, so survival is once again more important.

Since survival is more important than both parts of the mission, we can conclude that Survival > Completing the mission. Once Dumi's priorities are appropriately adjusted, we spring the "If you complete the mission, Dark Brain kills you" bit.

Yukiko Date ends her demand for solidarity. The holo-projector switches off. Vindel walks into the centre of the circle again.

"Now, I know what you may be thinking. 'How can she demand our help, after what she did here?'. 'How dare she talk down to us after slaying our friends?' 'How could trust a woman so psychotic as to destroy the DC just to prove a point?'. Well, it is good that you ask yourselves these things, because that proves you're human. But, to be human is also to survive. To survive, and to turn even the most terrible situation into victory."

"My friends, we have seen these First and Only, these inhuman dictators at the heart of the EFA, who seek to turn us all into their cattle. I created the Shadow Mirror to tear them down, even without know their true face, because I knew then, as now, that such a thing went against the human spirit. You all pledged with me that we would see the EFA fall, and the world returned to its natural state. This, my friends, is our chance to make that reality."

"In 36 hours, I will call Director Date and tell her the Shadow Mirror will work with her. We will allow her to take us in, to equip us, to see us turned into her weapon. Together, we will see the EFA brought down, in flames, and the First scourged from the Earth. And then, as the fool tries to forge her new regime, she will find that her new weapon has two edges. We cut out her black heart, and finally, once and for all, the ambition of those who treat humanity like sheep will be crushed, and the true Mankind will shine forth once again!"

Also, the series is no stranger to battleships, giant mechs and vehicles of epic proportions, not to mention evil empires, wars and diplomacy. Also, Megaman can turn into a giant mech in some iterations.

So I say that the Megaman series would fit with the tone of SRW.

As for Metal Gear, I say that the theme of those games are similar to FMP's. Terrorist that got their hands on incredibly powerfull mechs with weapons that, while they lack raw power, they have incredible abilities that let them neutralize other mech's abilities. So I don't think it would be impossible to fit it in.

Metroid.....I just added it because I love Metroid.

I have to bring up two issues with dimension-hopping that I think should be addressed before we go completely gung-ho on it.

The first is that it abandons a lot of our plot up to this point. We won't be able to bring along every or even most of the characters we would want in our party. We'll also have a harder time actually building a lot of the things we've been wanting up until this point - I doubt the Neo will get built if we jump around all over the place, nor will the Balder I whipped up earlier this thread. We'll have to abandon our Machine Cells because we won't be able to refine them without Sophia, and having them when we cross Dark Brain will be literal suicide. This will leave the Raioh weakened, since we've been relying on them a lot up until now. We don't have the resources at the moment to build DaiRaiOh or our equivalent, and won't until either we get the real Cells or go with Vindel to see Yukiko, who might be able to hook us up with the upgrade parts.

The second is the strain that doing all these non-originals series will put on Sciencegar. As a writer, I imagine it's already a pain just to handle the OG crew, which is why we've only met a handful of them. Writing other people's characters is -hard-, and throwing in a clusterfuck of series will almost definitely lead to OOC writing, frustration on Sciencegar's part, or both.

Looks like SOMEONE's been banned from stardestroyer.net and/or TV Tropes.

Anyhoo, my own series consideration:
- Endless Frontier (for lolz and cracking open the rest of those W-series for helping hands)
- Kamen Rider W (because Katina put the coordinates for SRW W in wrong)
- SRW W (for Valcazard)
- Gundam SEED Destiny (forge alliance with Junk Guild/Serpent Tail and glass the place)
- GEAR Fighter Dendoh (for batteries and shota)
- Zone of the Enders (because we'd steamroll MGS proper tech-wise)
- Pokemon (breather episode; also Mewtwo can give Arado an awesome "quit that revenge shit" speech or something)
- Vanilla Evangelion (to point and laugh, and stock up on Tang)
- Sliders (to learn dimension-jumping from the masters)
- Rider War World (for quarry stock footage)
- GBA Original Generation world (to finish the Neo Grungust)
- back to SM world to wrap up

What if instead of hopping lots and lots of universes, we simply hop into a third universe that has the series we want clumped in?

And then, instead of bringing a lot of people here, we only bring Katina, Dumi and some other key friends with us?

And then proceed to separate the game in two routes: the Katina route and the SM route by usign a storytelling we used when Katina met Rand and the SRX attacked us?

Let me compile my current ideas so far for ease of access

Okay, what to do with our 36 hours.

1: Repair and upgrade the Raioh
2: Try to see if we can fight Alfimi again, and possibly recruit her.
3: Look for people who disagree with the decision to ally with Yukiko.

4. Get in contact with the irregulars.

At the end of the 36 hours, we have Dumi take us dimension hopping with some others (Latooni, whoever else we can convince to come along, and perhaps some of the irregulars,) while we look for an alternate solution to our various problems. Then we return and turn the tide, beat down Dark Brain or whatever it is, and celebrate

Characters to take:
Katina - Leader
Dumi - Responsible for transportation, among other things
Latooni - Second in command
Axel
Lamia
Ibis (If we can get her back)
Alfimi (if we can find a way to get her to come along)
Bullet (Possibly, if he doesn't feel like sticking around Vindel)
Villeta/Bet Barshem
Despinis
Tis
Sophia - Mechanic
Wodan - Comes with Sophia by default
Arado (only if he won't try to kill us)
Ring (She's looking mighty badass)
Russel

Series:
GaoGaiGar.
Getter Robo.
Mazinger.
UC Gundam.
Seed Astray
Gaiking (Legend of Daiku Maryu version)

"Well well well..."

Seolla Schweizer is exactly as you remember her, thick oversized glasses, short-cropped silvery hair, and a School uniform that she seems uncomfortable in, perhaps owing to the fabric straining constantly against her ample chest. She is tied securely to the chair in the middle of the room, yet seems to retreat as you enter.

"No...Not you, not the Kraken..." The voice is a whisper, only audible because its so high-pitched.

"Awww, you remember me! I'm touched. And here I thought you'd left us all behind when you got your graduation slip. How was Izu Base, all nice and cushy, easy to hide from the boys there?"

"..Not going to say anything, can't make me."

"Oh, come now Seolla, we have so much catching up to do! It's been months since I've seen you, I mean, when was it?"

"...Don't even want to remember you...you always...got so close...."

You grin as you tussle her hair. "Oh, Seolla, being close together is what friends do! After all, didn't you stick to Ouka like glue all these years?"

"Ouka is my sister...my precious sister..."

"Really? Just a sister? I recall you staying in her room, against regulations, one more than one occasion. Following her everywhere, like a puppy, is that sisterly love, or more than that?"

"I just wanted protection....Protection from the likes of you..."

The knive glints as the front of Seolla tunic opens. You're vaguely shocked that she found a bra that size.

"Yes, well, Big Sis Ouka isn't here anymore, so, you're just going to have to settle for me, and Lat, and the others. They're going to be your new friends, Seolla. Real friends, not vapid egomaniacs like her. And you're going to be real friendly to them. Understand?"

"Won't betray....my oaths...."

You hook the knife under the middle of the bra. "Oaths to that bitch?! You really value that? I'm going to give you a harsh lesson, Seolla, in what licking that she-wolfs rug will get yo-"

The crash sounds like the Trilobite has been torn in half. You whip around and see...it, framed in the doorway, as the tortured hinges finally give out and the ruined door falls away.

"I didn't think it was possible for you to get worse, Katina, but once again, you've surprised me."

"A-a-a-a-a-a..."

Seolla blinks, her glasses nearly falling off her nose. "Arado..."

"Put the knife away, Katina. Or I'll take it off you."

Arado's face softens slightly, and he bends down to you. "Katina....I won't lie to you, I'm still angry about what you did. Being killed isn't something you forget in a hurry. But...I'm still your friend, Katina. I want to help you, like I did before, in the School. Stop this bullshit psycho-macho crap, and untie Seolla. You're better than this!"

People really need to learn that it doesn't matter if the enemy in question is a cute young girl, if they've been trained and modified to be human weapons, they're fucking dangerous and should be treated as so.

Think about the source material, though. If the OGers caught an enemy? Did they imprison and torture that pilot for information? While they did generally keep the captive locked up for a bit, eventually they let them wander around so they could be exposed to the atmosphere of TRUST and FRIENDSHIP and thus be converted to their cause.

...though now that I think about it, I don't think the Shadow Mirrors have that going on. Sooo... while we shouldn't fuck her up, at least keeping her in a cell isn't a bad idea.

"NO! This isn't just about the School!" You pick youself up off the floor. "She's still on the other side, and she's still the only link we've got to where Russel and Ibis are! I...I'm not going to abandon friends anymore...I've learnt that at least..."

"Wheren't you listening to the Colonel, Katina? In 36 hours there'll only be one side. You'll get back your new pals, Seolla will go to her people. And we'll be working together again!" Arado snaps off the ropes like they were nothing. "You don't torture people you're gonna be working with in two days...well, proper professional soldiers don't anyway."

"Since when did you care about being professional, you schmoozing cassanova!?"

"Hey, I have some standards when it comes to a fight! Hey, Seolla!"

The girl dances past the two of you, and flees into a corner of the corridor. She pulls a fire blanket off the wall and throws it over her head, then curls into a sobbing ball.

"...You dumb... dammit... That's Seolla, K! Seolla the Mouse, Ouka the Eagle, Latooni the Lioness, Arado the Shrike, Katina the Kraken! Little Arklight and Sparky Selain from Class J! Cuervo the Pope looking after us! We were a fucking family, Katina! How can you do that to your goddamn family!!?!"
