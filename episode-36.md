# Episode 36

##SRWQ Mission 36: We can rebuild them. We have the technology.

In our last thread, our heroine had a brief duel with a mysterious First and only warrior called Alfimi, who cheated to get out of Katinas rape-hug and forced Shuu to save our heroine. Reestablishing contact with the base, Katina learned that her allies had been attacked, and hurt. Badly.

As our heroine races to rejoin the group, other forces plot their own nefarious schemes, some to achieve peace and security, others to topple empires and spread bloodshed. Will the planet, nay, the universe, survive this storm?

*That wasn't wise, Dr. Shirakawa. Surely you've realised the state of the interdimensional borders, teleporting so many people at once is incredibly dangerous.*

"I assure you, 'Dumi', that I've already observed the dimensional interference effect you mention, and compensated for it. The Granzon is now shielded from such disturbances, and can travel safely at will."

*With the sideeffect that now I can't scan it at all, where before it was only its core I couldn't scan.*

"...Indeed."

The Raioh lands on the blast-plain, and you look out over a vast expanse of what haw once thick rainforest, but is now bare earth. The vegetation has been blasted from the earth for miles around, and the soil ripped away, revealing bare rock in patchs.

The furrow in the earth, marking the centre of the beams path, passes right through the eastern part of the DC base. Little remains except the twisted hulks of two Rhinoceros battleships. The western half of the base has merely been flattened, with the battered but intact Trilobites the only things standing. Wreckage lies everywhere, some of it blown half a mile south by the force of the blast.

"Jesus....where do I start?"

You step down from the Raiohs hatch into the hangar, circling around the crater left by some sort of energy grenade. Given what happened, the Trilobites hangar is in pretty good shape.

Latooni sit on a bench tapping away at her datapad. "Hey, Subota, how's things with you? It seems you come out of it unscathed."

"Naturally. Enjoy your holiday?"

"It wasn't a holiday! I was working hard, getting us deals with aliens and saving the ELF leader! And kicking ass, I might add. Why, if anything I deserve a holiday after all th-"

"What is Dumi? What is he really?"

You're caught up short by the girls intense gaze.

"He says he's on our side, but he hasn't lifted a wing since we got here. He let the Irregulars claim the Zweizergain, and the only thing he did in the battle was watch and shield the Trilobites from the blast. He won't talk to anyone, only giving Irm the most curt of replies. We can't even be sure thats actually Dumi and not some alien weapon that stole his command codes. Now, explain, Katina."

"It is Dumi, the same Dumi who's been helping us all this time! It just that, well, he wasn't exactly made on Earth, and he was looking for his real body at the same time he was helping us."

"I see... And now that he has this body, what is he going to do? He hasn't moved since the battle, is he calculating something, recharging, what?"

"I... er... He told me he was trying to find something on this world..."

"So he's an Irregular?"

"Well, not in the same sense, but... kinda..."

Latooni sits up. "It seems to me you need to get some proper answers, Tarask. You're the only one that thing seems to trust, so you'd better sort this out. Oh, and here."

She hands you a keycard. "Cell 3. She doesn't like being touched." With that, she walks off.

"Don't you want to hear about the Aliens? Me kicking ass in China? The Sexy tentacle girl who came onto me?"

Latooni hops into the elevator, the doors closing behind her.

---

ELSEWHERE.

Vindel watches the end of the file. "Have you shown this to anyone else?"

Irm shakes his head. "No sir, but the Irregulars have their own copy."

"Right. Gather the crew in Trilobite 1 in fifteen minutes. And prepare a holoprojector."

---

"Dumi? Dumi, I know you can hear me!"

*Yes, Katina. How can I help you?*

"Dumi... whats gotten into you? Ever since China, you've been out of touch, and not just with me. Latooni said you hadn't tlaked to anyone, and you didn't help the guys fight off the SRX. What are you thinking, Dumi?"

*I... I don't... Ok. There's a... storm, coming, from the Endless Frontier. It's wrapping this universe in tendrils of indescribable darkness, making it almost impossible to access other dimensions. My last teleport nearly crippled me, I can't access the components that exist in hyperspace, and even my hyperwave link to my three homonculi is starting to pick up static. I can't tell exactly what caused this storm, but I know its something bad. And... I have the horrible feeling... I may be part of the cause...*

"Wha...Dumi, what did you do?"

*I activated my body and started teleporting around. Shuu turned on his Granzon. The Balmarians powered up their Neviim. The Huckebien R exploded. I arrived here. The Shadow Mirrors punched a hole in space, and travelled through it. Then the Irregulars stopped them, turning back time and altering their own reality in the process. Each of these things is like a note in a song, drawing up the snake from the pot, and is weakening the barriers that keep worlds apart. Its a cumulative process, but one that has been building from what we've been doing.*

"So... We called something here? What is it?"

*Why does everyone keep asking me that? I! Don't! Know! That's whats freaking me out here! It could be Dark Brain, it could be his retard hillbilly cousin. It could be a demon, or an angel, god or devil. There could one or a billion of them. I can't tell, because the storm blocks everything! The only way to know would be to venture out into it, and see directly...*

"And are you going to do that?"

*...I don't know if I should... when I can just leave.*

"Leave? LEAVE?"

*I'm the most dimensionally active entity in this section of space right now, except maybe for that Geist thing of the Irregulars. Whatever comes through that storm, it'll likely look for me first. I-I can't risk it being... him. Any other entity I'd face, at the least, to protect you from it. But if its him, I'm powerless. If I can get the Kaiser, and leave this dimension, I can maybe lead it away, and complete my mission. Your dimension, and I, would be safe.*

"B-but... *sniff* Dumiiii, you can't just leave me. You said we'd be partners, didn't you? You wouldn't lie to me about that! You wouldn't!!!"

*Katina... I want... I want you to consider, at least... leaving this world, and coming with me.*

"What?!?"

*I know it would be tough, for a being of only one world like you, to abandon your home and travel the Frontier, but... it's the only way we could stay together. And if we get lucky, we could come back here, perhaps. At least to visit. Maybe... maybe you'd prefer it out there! Yes, the Frontier is a wonderful place, with infinite possibility. I'm sure you'd take to it quite well...*

"D-Dumi, I... I don't... You really think this is the only way?"

*I... Well... I suppose... Well, I can't... I don't... I don't know. There might be some other way... but I can't think of one. Everytime I try to think around the issue, my primary programming activates, and intrudes on my higher thought functions. Getting the Kaiser and returning to Dark Brain... it's like one of those songs that gets stuck in your head, you know? I can't think of any thing else. If... If you can, think of another way... I'll listen. I can still do that at least.*

"W... Well... Um..."

"This is Irm to all Shadow Mirrors. Return to Trilobite 1s hangar immediately. Colonel Mauser has returned, and he has something to show you."

---

"First of all, I wish to apologise for my absence in this time of crisis. You have all struggled valiantly against the EFAs constant attacks to keep the Shadow Mirrors alive, while I allowed myself to be incarcerated by people I thought were our allies. I wish I could have done more, found some way to rejoin you sooner, but finally, thanks to the efforts of Ms Tarask, I can finally rejoin you, and work to put this whole mess right."

Vindel indicates you, and many turn to stare at you, some appprovingly, many in surprise, more than one in abject horror.

"The situation on our planet has changed. When previously, the EFA had backed us into a corner, and forced us to attempt the jump to another world, now many forces are marching, the EFA has been bloodied by your efforts and those of others, and the world has been thrown into chaos. And Chaos, dear friends, is our lifes blood."

"Yesterday, you were attacked by the most powerful unit in the EFA today. Thanks to your amazing talents and determination, you survived this encounter with minimal losses, when the DC, the army which once tried to take over the planet, died like dogs. Make no mistake, this is proof of our ability. Proof so obvious, even the enemy has to admit it... Irm, show them the file."

---

Yukiko Date ends her demand for solidarity. The holo-projector switches off. Vindel walks into the centre of the circle again.

"Now, I know what you may be thinking. 'How can she demand our help, after what she did here?'. 'How dare she talk down to us after slaying our friends?' 'How could trust a woman so psychotic as to destroy the DC just to prove a point?'. Well, it is good that you ask yourselves these things, because that proves you're human. But, to be human is also to survive. To survive, and to turn even the most terrible situation into victory."

"My friends, we have seen these First and Only, these inhuman dictators at the heart of the EFA, who seek to turn us all into their cattle. I created the Shadow Mirror to tear them down, even without know their true face, because I knew then, as now, that such a thing went against the human spirit. You all pledged with me that we would see the EFA fall, and the world returned to its natural state. This, my friends, is our chance to make that reality."

"In 36 hours, I will call Director Date and tell her the Shadow Mirror will work with her. We will allow her to take us in, to equip us, to see us turned into her weapon. Together, we will see the EFA brought down, in flames, and the First scourged from the Earth. And then, as the fool tries to forge her new regime, she will find that her new weapon has two edges. We cut out her black heart, and finally, once and for all, the ambition of those who treat humanity like sheep will be crushed, and the true Mankind will shine forth once again!"

"Do you really think that'll work?"

Your voice cuts through the applause and cheers. Everyone turns aroung this time.

"You seriously think this bitch will just let us backstab her? If she's gone to all this trouble, she'll be ready for us. She'll set us up to die before we even get close to hurting her."

Vindel smiles thinly. "Miss Tarask, are you doubting the abilities of your fellow Shadow Mirrors? This type of work is exactly what they're trained for: Finding the vunerabilities of others and exploiting them. Also, Date may think she knows everything about us, but we have aces up our sleeve. Many of them thanks to you personally."

"Er... Well..."

"Come now, its not like you to worry. Trust in your friends, they'll see you through this. And feel free to bounce ideas off each other, brainstorming some contingency plans can't hurt us, now can it?"

"...Right."

"We have 36 hours to prepare, lets see if we can't get our affairs in order, ok?"

---

"Well well well..."

Seolla Schweizer is exactly as you remember her, thick oversized glasses, short-cropped silvery hair, and a School uniform that she seems uncomfortable in, perhaps owing to the fabric straining constantly against her ample chest. She is tied securely to the chair in the middle of the room, yet seems to retreat as you enter.

"No... Not you, not the Kraken..." The voice is a whisper, only audible because its so high-pitched.

"Awww, you remember me! I'm touched. And here I thought you'd left us all behind when you got your graduation slip. How was Izu Base, all nice and cushy, easy to hide from the boys there?"

"...Not going to say anything, can't make me."

"Oh, come now Seolla, we have so much catching up to do! It's been months since I've seen you, I mean, when was it?"

"...Don't even want to remember you... you always... got so close..."

You grin as you tussle her hair. "Oh, Seolla, being close together is what friends do! After all, didn't you stick to Ouka like glue all these years?"

"Ouka is my sister... my precious sister..."

"Really? Just a sister? I recall you staying in her room, against regulations, one more than one occasion. Following her everywhere, like a puppy, is that sisterly love, or more than that?"

"I just wanted protection... Protection from the likes of you..."

The knive glints as the front of Seolla tunic opens. You're vaguely shocked that she found a bra that size.

"Yes, well, Big Sis Ouka isn't here anymore, so, you're just going to have to settle for me, and Lat, and the others. They're going to be your new friends, Seolla. Real friends, not vapid egomaniacs like her. And you're going to be real friendly to them. Understand?"

"Won't betray... my oaths..."

You hook the knife under the middle of the bra. "Oaths to that bitch?! You really value that? I'm going to give you a harsh lesson, Seolla, in what licking that she-wolfs rug will get yo-"

The crash sounds like the Trilobite has been torn in half. You whip around and see... it, framed in the doorway, as the tortured hinges finally give out and the ruined door falls away.

"I didn't think it was possible for you to get worse, Katina, but once again, you've surprised me."

"A-a-a-a-a-a..."

Seolla blinks, her glasses nearly falling off her nose. "Arado..."

"Put the knife away, Katina. Or I'll take it off you."

"A-arado... Oh god... it's really you, the real one..." You drop to your knees, the knife tumbling from nerveless fingers. "H-how... Oh god... It can't really be true, can it?"

Arado's face softens slightly, and he bends down to you. "Katina... I won't lie to you, I'm still angry about what you did. Being killed isn't something you forget in a hurry. But... I'm still your friend, Katina. I want to help you, like I did before, in the School. Stop this bullshit psycho-macho crap, and untie Seolla. You're better than this!"

"UMMA SORREEEE! IJUSTWANNASAVEIBISISISSIS!! And then she talks about HER!! She took you awaayy! And then she made yo-"

The slap sends you to the ground, hard. A lesser person would probably have lost teeth from the force.

"Goddammit, Katina. Are you going to keep fooling yourself? Ouka didn't 'steal' me, I went to her. And you couldn't admit that you'd pushed me away with your goddamn antics. We could have had something, but you poisoned it! I... I wanted you, you dumb... dumb woman, but you wouldn't... let me in."

"N-no, she... She would talk about it, to me... she'd say... Um... stuff, about you two... And there was the time in the simulator, when she tripped me up... And, er, the Noodle Incident..."

"Katina, seriously. Ouka... Yes she was a haughty bitch. Yes she was full of herself and her combat rankings. But she... at least she didn't beat her goddamn friends. She didn't tie the younger kids up in the bathroom for kicks! And she didn't fucking choke her boyfriend to death in a fucking tiff."

You can barely hear him with the blood roaring in your ears. You fall into the fetal position, hot tears burning your face.

"Katina... If you're not going to end this shit..." He turns to Seolla and tugs on the ropes.

"NO! This isn't just about the School!" You pick youself up off the floor. "She's still on the other side, and she's still the only link we've got to where Russel and Ibis are! I... I'm not going to abandon friends anymore... I've learnt that at least..."

"Wheren't you listening to the Colonel, Katina? In 36 hours there'll only be one side. You'll get back your new pals, Seolla will go to her people. And we'll be working together again!" Arado snaps off the ropes like they were nothing. "You don't torture people you're gonna be working with in two days... well, proper professional soldiers don't anyway."

"Since when did you care about being professional, you schmoozing cassanova!?"

"Hey, I have some standards when it comes to a fight! Hey, Seolla!"

The girl dances past the two of you, and flees into a corner of the corridor. She pulls a fire blanket off the wall and throws it over her head, then curls into a sobbing ball.

"...You dumb... dammit... That's Seolla, K! Seolla the Mouse, Ouka the Eagle, Latooni the Lioness, Arado the Shrike, Katina the Kraken! Little Arklight and Sparky Selain from Class J! Cuervo the Pope looking after us! We were a fucking family, Katina! How can you do that to your goddamn family!!?!"
