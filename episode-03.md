## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

####SRWQ Mission 3: It's not /tg/, it's /u/

You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask. You wear frilly dresses and don't afraid of anything.

You and the other Shadow Mirrors were about to escape destruction by the EFA by travelling to another dimension, when an army of mechs from that dimension arrived to...do something. It wasn't entirely clear what was happening, but then things started exploding. You and your allies climbed into a Tausendfuessler and escaped the Tesla-Liecht Institute, but you were followed.

Then the ghost of your best friend Arado, who you strangled with a power lead in a fit of psychotic rage 2 months ago, came back from hell to claim your soul for your many sins.

Or at least that's how you see it.

#####Your allies:

Irmgard Kazahara: Womaning super robot pilot and son of one of Shadow Mirrors main scientists. Hasn't realised he's not in charge, you are. Piloting a modified Gust Lander.

Latooni Subota: Cold, dispassionate strategist and sniper. Graduate of the School, who kicked you out for being too crazy. Thinks this makes her better than you. You intent to teach her who's boss later. In bed. Piloting a Randgrith.

Russel Bagman: A nice Irish man who recruited you into the Shadow Mirror. Smart enough to know to follow your orders. In a Gespenst.

I. Douglas: Some redheaded chick who likes guns, who Russel saved from the EFA. You haven't actually asked her name yet, just read her nametag: You've been too worked up about Subota to notice her. In a red Gespenst that seems to have sentimental value to her.

Johnathan Kazahara: Scientist dude. Too old for your tastes. Flying the Tausendfuessler.

The Transport: Apparently full of more minions and mechs. Landed just a short distance from your Tausendfeussler.

#####Your Enemies:

The Transforming thing with the overly dramatic guy in it: Fighting your Gespensts.

The flying one with the sniper rifle: In a sniper duel with Latooni and Irm.

The Devil Ghost of Arado: A part of your mind registers that this is probably just the version of Arado from the other dimension, but you stopped listening to that part of your brain when Aguila took away Mr Flopsy after you joined The School.

#####SUDDENLY ACTUAL PLOT

"Ack!! Get off me!!! Stop, Katina!"

"IT WASN'T MY FAULT!! YOU BROKE OUR PROMISE!! THAT SLUT DIDN'T DESERVE YOU!!! IT JUST HAPPENED!!"

You are holding desperately onto the leg of the Wild Wuerger, raining blow after blow on it, as Arado desperately manuvers to try to throw you off. Your R-Blades tonfa is now tearing chunks of the Jacket Armor off, exposing the more vunerable mech inside.

"D-dammit, Katina, you're forcing me to do something I don't want to..."

"LIKE YOU FORCED YOURSELF ON THAT BIG-TITTED SLUT???"

"Wha....TO HELL WITH YOU!!"

The Stag Beetle Crusher snags your blade arm, gets a firm grip, and then rips the arm right out of its socket and tosses it away."

"THERE! Now will you let go of me and stop saying things that don't make sense?"

"Arado-kuuuun, why do you always hurt me-he-he-heeee??"

"DAMMIT I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU!!"

Arado points the Wuergers left arm at you. It has a rather nice sword holstered in it, but more to the point, its has 3 heavy-caliber machine cannons that at pointed at the R-blades head.

"I'm only going to count to three..."

"BAAAAAAWHAWHAWHAAAAW!! I just wanted a friend! The School was so hard, I wanted someone to talk to! Someone to share the heartache! Please....I don't to be alone..."

"....ngh....Dammit..."

The arm cannons are lowered, and the Wuerger starts to lose altitude.

"I'm going to drop you off on the ground, and then you're going to get your friends to stop this pointless fight, alright."

"This fight isn't over UNTIL I SAY IT'S OVER!!!"

The Head Vulcans rattle into the Wuerger's face, cracking one camera. Your left tonfa discarded to grab the leg, you reach out and pull on the Wuergers Cold Metal Sword. However, your yank on the hilt, even at full boost, fails to pull the blade out: It's locked into the arm assembly.

Arado's scream of formless fury is almost as loud as yours. The cannon shells disintegrate your left hand and most of the forearm, and suddenly, with no grip, you're falling.

>IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR YOU'D LIKE TO DO BEFORE YOU HIT THE GROUND??

"FUCKSHITCUNTASSMOTHERFUCKINGPURPLEHAIREDDICKPUSSY!!!" You scream as you fall, firing off your vulcans wildly. Arado flies the Wuerger out of you fire arc.

"What in the heck?!?! The real Katina was never this crazy. At least, not as often..."

"Russel!! Catch me you fat irish fuck!!!"

BZHZHZZHZHHZ

"...Russel?"

You boost out of the fall and land roughly but intact near the Trilobite. You look up and see Russel's blue Gespenst lying immobile, missing both its arms. Beyond them, Ibis is desperately boosting away from the Transforming Mech, which is taking potshots at her with a revolver.

"Ah! No! I can't let you damage this mech! It's Sleighs!"

"Please, Mirror-Ibis, you have to calm dow-"

"Stop calling me that!!"

You shrug and head toward the Trilobite.

"That flying style...I know you."

"That voice!"

"You're Bronzo 27, aren't you?"

"L-Latooni??"

Latooni had already anticipated the second of confusion. An armor-piercing shell rips through the Wildfalkens upper torso, disabling the right arm and smashing the Tesla Drive. Seolla's mech dropped like a rock.

"Damn you!!!"

The Cold Metal Sword slices through Latooni's Linear Cannon, and the Wuerger's leg strikes the side of her units cockpit-head. Latooni grits her teeth and fights the urge to vomit from the rocking.

"Bronzo 28...Arado Balanga."

"No! To hell with this! I don't care if you are Latooni, you Shadow Mirrors are all crazy!! We came here to end your stupid organisation, and we will! And if some of you madmen die on the way, I won't shed any tears!!!"

Feint with the Scissor Knife. Pointblank Matrix missiles.

Block with the Crusher. Duck under the missiles and slash at legs. Hydraulics reduced to 50% pressure.

Much better than our Arado, thinks Latooni.

Spider Net from torso launcher. Shoulder charge, gain distance, more missiles.

Trapped in net. Counter charges. Cold Metal Sword severs right arm. Crusher grabs torso, maintaining pointblank range.

Too good, she realises.

The Stag Beetle Crusher closes its vicelike grip, metal shears. Struggling to prevent Arado beheading her with his sword, Latooni realised that even the durable Randgrith is in danger of simply being snapped in half under the pressure.

A lucky shot bursts the fuel lines on Ibis' left leg, tripping her Gespenst up. Irm stands conflicted, unable to decide which girl to try to save.

"Irm!! Save Ibis, I'll see about the cailin in the glasses!" Slash rippers emerge from the back of Russel's Gespenst and fly at Arado. The last of the Wuerger's jacket armor is ripped away as the blades worry at him like rabid dogs. Free from his indecision, Irm fires off a waves at the R-1, then charges at it, Drill screaming as it revs to full power.

Arado releases the stricken Randgrith and starts to fight the buzzing Slash Rippers. Latooni's mech slowly sinks to the ground, the shattered chassis unable to hold up its own wieght anymore.

"Change, R-Wiiiing!!!" Ryusei transforms and flies away from the swarm of missiles. Meant for destroying fortresses and battleship, the R-wing easily outraces them, turns around and blasts them with its own missiles.

The Slash Rippers suddenly pop like clay pigeons. Russel turns around to see the Wildfalken steadying itself on a boulder, sighting its rifle right at him.

"Stand down, you....you goddamn meatheads!!!"

"Seolla..."

"I can swear if I want!"

"STAND BACK MORTALS, MAKE WAY FOR THE **GODDESS OF VICTORY!!!** "

Arado sighs. "Not her again..."

The Raioh strides out of the Trilobite, wrapping a red cloth around its neck as it goes.

"Why are you doing that?" calls Rio from the Trilobite's cockpit. "That's just the tarpaulin we were covering it with."

"DON'T....question me?"

Ryusei is temporarily stunned. "A Kamen Rider mech?? That is so damned cool!! If a bit old-school."

"Right then, who shall be the first to be sacrificed on my altar of pain??"

No-one responds immediately, then a mechanical voice interjects.

*While the Raioh is a high-end Super Robot, the capabilities of these new units are not to be underestimated. Perhaps you could acquiese to a little support?*

Pic related strides out of the Trilobite, and joins you.

"What are you meant to be? Some kind of computer?"

I am the Dynamic Unlimited Military Intelligence, Operation AI of DDG-XAM-04. You may call me Dumi-chan.

"Doomy???....I like it. Now lets go kick some ass"

#####INTERLUDE: ELSEWHERE

Axel approaches the northern camp, and finds a few scattered Gespensts hiding behind a ridge.

"Captain Axel!! Thank god you're here! We're completely lost! What's going on."

"Commitees still out. What are you hiding from? EFA?"

"Er...no...it's a little more complicated than that..."

Axel leaps up to the top of the ridge, and has a good look at the scene.

"Well now....that is complicated, now that you mention it."
