We were following the exploits of the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask, a cutely-dressed psycho with many, many issues, as she tries to survive exploit the arrival of the OG Heroes to her dimension. However, we've gotten caught up in a major battle at which out heroine is absent, but her allies battle fiercely to save the last of the shadow mirrors from the girl in the pic. (Crappy MSPaint cut-and-paste art is a legitimate use of this board dammit!)

Results of last threads vote coming presently.

She's more use to us alive than dead. And another potential harem member's always good.

If we capture her, Katina gets to have some fun. Whereas if we leave her to die, you can be pretty certain she'll get picked up by one of her friends and she'll be back with a new mech.

Irm throttles forward. "Russel, you and me will secure that R-Blade. Dumi, stop the Angelg from sinking. Echidna, Ibis, get those enemies off the Trilobite. Arado, see if you can't help Axel."

Roger. The DGG-04 switches to Motorad mode and dives underwater. The other all signal acknowledgement, except for Arado.

"Uh, are you sure Axel wants help? I mean....he is Axel, after all..."

"Just make sure he doesn't die!!" Irm and Russel head to were the R-Blade sank.

"Russel, can you see the R-Blade on the Sonar?"

"Yeah, its not down too far. Only a few meters...wait, its still moving!!"

With a burst of spray, the R-Blade boosts a short distance out of the water, and stabs downward with a blunted Tonfa. The weapon embeds itself in Russel's leg, as the R-Blade drags itself out of the water by the handle.

"Not yet! I'm too powerful to die to the like of you! I won't go back empty-handed!!"

Got a question for you. If you hated this thing since the dawn of time, why haven't you actually DONE anything while it was going on previous? It has been going on for 11 threads, and you never acted.

If you really hated it so much and if it were truly not allowed on /m/, the third thread would have been saged by now. Why only NOW do you choose to act?

But yeah, ignore this shit. It's just the internet.)

"Oh no you don't! Jet Magnum!"

Irm boosts forward to strike the mechs head as Russel struggles to bring his gun to bear. At the last moment, theres a blur of motion. The R-Blade leaps up, letting the Jet Magnum smash the Tonfa, and its feet impact on the head of Irm's Gespenst. Russel swings round his gun and fires a burst at nothing, before the second tonfa comes down on his arm. Only a reflex twitch stops the arm coming off altogether. The R-Blade dissappears in a splash.

"Surrender to me, mortals, and you will become part of a grand design. Resist, and you have no future!!"

"Jaysus! Theres still a lot of fight in that cailin!"

"When we capture her, we'll have to introduce her to Katina. I'd imagine they'd get along like a house on fire."

"Literally."

If we ignore her she can easily just run away. Unlikely given her "must win!" complex, but still possible for her to pull off a retreat. Just have Russel and Irm keep and eye on her, don't take any major risks but don't let her just run. Then when the rest of the group finishes taking out the guys harassing the Trib, grab her and then go help Axel.

The R-0s empty their G-Railguns into the Bridge of the Trilobite, but the armor just manages to hold. They're fleeing, running a merry chase from the Vysaga as it closes in, claws extended.

"Attacking a ship full of wounded. I won't even stoop to calling you warriors!"

The R-0s flit back and forth, firing their head vulcans ineffectually, before the air around them begins to explode. Mini-missiles from the Rathgrith strike one, disabling it and sending it crashing to the roof of the Trilobite. The other dodges the Schutzwalds beam cannon, but runs into a burst of autocannon shells, sending the mech retreating over the water, trailing smoke and sparks.

"Told you I was better with projectile weapons!" gloats Ibis.


"Give *huff* it up, *huff* girly. Your little black toy *huff* is wrecked!"

"You're *puff* not in great shape yourself, *puff* Almer!"

The Soulgain looks like a cat thats been thrown into a dog pound. The Schwartzritter looks like a cat thats been thrown into a dogfood blender. How its still flying is a mystery for the ages.

"M-mister Axel, I've been asked to ask you i-if you need help."

The Schwartzritter turns to face the Gaurlion. "That voice...Impossible!!!"

"Hah! Don't turn your back on an enemy. RULE ONE BITCH!!!" The Soulgain charges, and rams its fist into the cockpit of the Schwartzritter.

Well, technically. The fist certainly hits the Schwartzritter, but the force involved isn't exactly what you'd associate with 'ramming'. More...'tapping'.

"Wait...what...what's going..." Axel head lolls about the Soulgains cockpit, and turns to the head up display thats off to the side of his viewscreen.

In one of those I-never-realised-that-until-now moments, Axel figures out that its the Soulgain's status indicator, and all the bars are in the red.

"Well...sonuva..."

The Soulgain starts to sink towards the ocean, like a drunk taking entirely too long to fall on his ass.

This whole scene seems to snap the Black Knight back to her senses, and she engages what few boosters she has left, and heads away the way she came.

WHAT WILL ARADO DO? The Soulgain isn't totally disabled, but its heading that way fast. Catching up to the Schwartzritter would be trivial in the Guarlion.

I dunno if it's worth capturing Ouka. She's seems a lot more responsible (read: less likely to blab everything she knows if we get tricky) and harder to restrain than Shine. And, you know, she probably hates Katina.

On the other hand, she also might know more than Shine. That's about the only reason to capture her instead of killing. (and Shine hates all our guts too, so she's not going to be too useful once we get info out of her) Neither are going to fight for us.

"W-wait!!" The Guarlion reaches down and grabs the Soulgain, barely stabilising. If Arado were more technically minded, he might realise this is only possible because the Soulgain is missing so many components, but he's preoccupied right now.

"What are you two trying to do exactly, kill the sea?" Ibis hovers over to the patch of spent shell casing floating around Irm and Russel.

"Very funny Ibis. The R-Blade pilot is being annoying, she won't retreat, she won't give up, and every few minutes she pops up to slash at us. But then again, she's practically helpless down there, and we've recovered everyone else, right?"

Confirmed, Lt. 2G. We must depart from this space as soon as possible, and remove the pilots of the Angelg and the Soulgain from their mechs immediately.

"What? Are they injured, Dumi."

"The W-series piloting the Angelg has been severely damaged. She will require both medical treatment and extensive maintenance. And the damage to the Soulgain has caused it to enter a malformed absorption loop, draining the pilot of vital energy in an attempt to remain operational."

"Damn! Trilobite 01, close to Dumi's position and prepare to recover two super robots, ASAP!!"

Then space rips itself open.

"Dr. Shirakawa, I'm Irmgard Kazahara, son of Johnathan Kazahara. You met him once before, didn't you, at TLI?"

"Indeed!! A fine example of practical science, producing proud defenders of justice and advancing the scientific field!! What I learned there was well worth parting with my Clacker Engine theory!"

No, not necessarily. Masaki has a hell of a grudge, but he could probably accept a non-evil Shu. Didn't he forgive Shu in 4/F/Final after they explained the whole "he had an evil god in his head" thing? He also tends to get kind of bummed when Shu dies, he's just too nice of a guy to really be happy someone's dead. He'd probably be even less happy about killing someone who genuinely wants to do the right thing.

Of course, none of us really trust Shu at this point, so we're not in a position to convince Masaki he's not evil. But we might be able to stop a fight if we tell Masaki we have bigger problems, and has Shu spout some hero of justice stuff at him. At very least we can convince Masaki we have bigger problems, like Lamia being hurt.

For my own personal reference:

Katina in Raioh
Dumi in 04
Irm in Redpenst
Russel in Bluepenst
Kai getting a Gespenst Custom made
Latooni in Soldifar
Ibis in Schutzwald
Echidna in Rathgrith
??? in Wilbraubtier
OG Arado, Ryuune and Masaki
Axel, Lamia and Brooklyn
And finally Shuu and Ring.

This will make the next thread complicated...

We could tell him that its an evil little girl who needs to be unbrainwashed. Preferably through alone-time with Katina...

Derp. Took me a while to claw through all the crap, but anyways!

Good to see this has picked up some steam again. It's getting awesome and we've got a crapload of of new awesome machines too.

Quick question though. Does this new version of the Granzon turn into the Neo Granzon when Shu's sense of justice is at its absolute?

And possibly more importantly, does a revised version of BEAT A NAIL WITH YOUR HAMMER play when it transforms?
