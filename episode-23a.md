###SRWQ Mission 23A: IT KEEPS HAPPENING

Anyway, our 'heroine' Katina Tarask has just blasted off into the sky, with her ever-helpful AI pal Dumi, and Setsuko and Toby from the DC's Star Team, to knock out one of the EFAs spy satellites and give the DC and Shadow Mirrors a chance to get to their new base undetected. The jump to orbit will take about an hour.

---

Elsewhere...

"Director, the target group has launched 2 Super Robots and 2 AMs, on a course for a low earth orbit."

"Acknowledged, Black Knight." Yukiko Date turns to the papers on her desk. "What convenient timing, just as these 'orders' come in from Geneva."

Kirk Hamill frowns. "Is it possible theres any truth to them? That Shine was wrong, and these are aliens or some sort?"

"Weren't you listening, Hamill? Shine said they were from another dimension. I think that would qualify them as being not of this earth, wouldn't you?"

"If you really think so, it is our mandate to stop them."

"Our mandate is to keep the human race alive and free of alien influence, Hamill. We've already been compromising on it by not bombing Geneva. Now, we have to come up with a reponse to the Irregulars, and right now, we only know the whereabouts of one group. We'll have to concentrate on them, even if they're mostly Shadow Mirrors."

"An assault, then?"

"No...something more subtle."

 "So...Star-3, was it?"

"Er, you can call me Lt. Ohara, and my partner is Lt. Watson."

"You can call me Toby."

"We're supposed to be more formal with non-DC people, Lt. Watson."

"Ah come on Sets, they fought alongside us at the base, they've proven they're on our side."

"Damned right!!" You say. "We're all dedicated to the same thing, knocking down this stupid Federation and...erm, knocking it down good!!"

SPECIFIC TOPICS? Note that Katina doesn't know who made the Hyperlion mechs, although she could ask.

Poorly written, but a writefag thread.

And since it's a writefag thread, it's not an rp thread, since they're two entirely seperate things.

Ergo, you admit that this is not an rp thread!

"...That's a little forward of you, isn't it?"

"That's just how I roll."

Setsuko sighs. "If you must know, I've been affiliated with the Strategic War Research Institute since a young age, and joined the DC when they did. The whole thing was folded into Project TD in the last year."

Toby seems less reluctant. "I'm just one of those grunts that liked the sound of Zoldarks voice, and thought joining him to save the earth from aliens sounded awesome. Mistakes of youth, and all that."

"So...what do you think of Vat Tran? Happy working for him, or would you prefer to be with the sexy girl in California?"

Toby smirks. "A tempting offer, perhaps..."

"Toby! You're engaged!"

"I'm just kidding! Nah, Vat Trans the future of the DC. Ryuunes a politician, and Junkers is just a fangirl for the Branstiens. If the DC is going to survive, it needs a strong military leader like V-V-T."

So their defenses are these

-"You dont want us to have fun!"
-"Its not in the rules!"
-"mods don't delete it!"
-"We only stay in one thread we don't spread!"

First, its not fun, its only fun for a minority of people, its always the same guys posting on one thread.

Second, So ? Posting about animals on /m/ is not against the rules, should I start making threads about animals?

Third, Mods DO delete it, but /m/ only has ONE mod/janitor, there's so much they can do.

 Alright, this shit needs to stop RIGHT FUCKING NOW.

Seriously. When I look on the front page, you know what I see? A Madox thread, a Heavy Gear thread, a thread about gunpla, and a thread about boobs in mecha (If you're going to complain about the boob thread, you are a faggot. Everybody loves boobs. Especially when robots have them).

There is NOTHING wrong with /m/, except for the following two things: People who troll claiming to be bettering /m/, and people who feed the troll thinking that they're helping prove it wrong.

Trolls are always bad news, and should be ignored. Anybody who bites the bait, and I'll be the first one to admit I'm guilty of it just as much as anybody else is, should realize that constantly provoking the troll will not help anything. As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

If we actually have mods, which is doubtful, they're the ones who will take care of this shit. We don't need to derail a thread with assloads of trolling and responding to trolling, just because we want to do something about it. You want to stop the troll? Report him for abusing the sage and report functions, and leave it at that. Don't make a post explicitly stating you've reported him. Don't do anything other than reporting this faggot for abusing sage and report, and let the rest handle itself.

This shit has gone on long enough. Sure, I'll admit I contributed to it here and there by responding to the troll, but this has gotten out of hand. Everybody just shut the fuck up, and when the troll is the only thing sagebombing and image dumping a thread, he'll either get bored and leave or /m/'s probably-nonexistant mods/janitors will ban him for being a faggot who does this shit claiming to "clean up" /m/ when there's nothing wrong with it in the first place.

Tl;dr- Stop feeding the troll, you thundering faggots. It's only making things worse.

Of course, there are those people who aren't comfortable with their own sex, but then trying to account for them in a very brief imageboard post is trying a little too hard.

What? Girls love boobs.

I mean, how could they not? You'd have to love something that's part of you. Unless you have low self esteem.

...Or maybe you're flat. Then it's more envy than anything else, which is just another form of wanting boobs.

So, therefore, girls don't need to be mentioned seeing as it is assumed all women love boobs. Don't bother arguing about this, my logic is infallible.

Thats not the problem dumbass.

>There is NOTHING wrong with /m/, except for the following two things: People who troll claiming to be bettering /m/, and people who feed the troll thinking that they're helping prove it wrong.


You know shit, Theres TONS of things wrong in /m/. The lack of mods, the lack of proper Rules to tell us what is fucking allowed or not. Sure trolls are a problem but so are all these fucking tripfags who make tripfag threads/rpthreads and lacus stalkers etc. when was the last time /m/ actually gather together and was able to enjoy a mecha show together? Yeah its been a long fucking time. I'm not even going mention how toku also brought a lot of shit users to /m/. 


>If we actually have mods.

We DO have mods, but /m/ was so fucking cocky that we lost quite a few mods and moot stopped caring about us. its so bad on /m/ right now, that /v/ /a/ /b/ /co/ are far better places right now.
SRWQ threads wouldn't be a problem if it was strictly a fanfic, but its more than that it's a stupid disguised RP thread, instead of being a lulz Alpha portrait thread its a "serious" rp thread, those types of things belong in 1 place on 4chan, /tg/. Theres even a rider quest there and does not get shit up by /tg/ members. Yes I am well aware that the rules dont mention it but rules don't mention a lot of things, it doesn't mean its the right thing to post. please use more common sense. and maybe JUST MAYBE we can work and make /m/ a better place.

 (Not enough votes among the DRAMA to count, so gonna throw a plot brick)

As the kilometers flash by and the sky dissipates into darkness, you hear a familiar voice in your eardrum.

Katina...Do you think we'll have anything like enough firepower to survive this?

"Huh? Well...we kick loads of ass! Look what we did to the Cry Wolves, and the Hagane? And those Project SRX goons! We're doing great!"

That is still only a small fraction of the EFAs forces, and even with that our mechs took quite a pounding. We were fortunate that things worked out that way, but chance could easily fail us next time.

"Maybe, but...we're going to be getting all sorts of machine-cell mechs soon! And I'm sure we'll come up with something else!"

The Machine Cells will soon be completely under the control of Vat Tran's DC, not us, and I can't see us joining him permanently. Allies like the Star Team may be temporary at best. We need to find another way to increase the forces at our command.

 "And do you have any suggestions, Dumi? Oh wait, you're Dumi, you always do."

I'll take that as a compliment. I'm scanning my databanks, and I do beleive there may be something. Shadow Mirror intelligence apparently had suspicions about a resource satellite, just on the far side of the moon. Reports are sketchy, but apparently they suspected it was some form of weapons factory, belonging to which faction was unclear.

"Huh...isn't that a bit out of our way?"

On our current units, without a doubt. But if we were to secure ourselves a proper vessel, perhaps claim one from the EFA, we may be able to make it there within a day.

Well, Wodan's not going anywhere without Sophia. It's more a matter of if Sophia should come with us or not, seeing as Wodan's her guard.

As for others who could come with us, Latooni might enjoy breaking away from the main force for a bit. She did say she wanted us to start taking risks, after all. (She also doesn't have to know this was Dumi's plan, and that we're just being strung along by a suspiscious AI. It might diminish her opinion of us.)

If we run the plan past him, Axel would probably want to stay earthside to run things and make sure he can kick Beowulf's ass if he shows up.

Ibis would probably want to go into space, but she's also more inclined to want to stay earthside if she finds out we've got Sleigh. Or we could just take both of them.

We could probably convince Shu to help us, by telling him it's for the greater good if we're better prepared.

And we might as well take Lamia with us. Because she's got huge airbags, so if we hit something in space we can use her as a deflector array.

 "Well, that sounds interesting, but where do we get a ship? And who should come along with us? We'd have to get Lat up here, maybe that chick with the big boobs for shock absorption, and see if we can't get Dr. Na-"

I think we can do it ourselves. With a little help from some pals of mine, of course.

"Huh? You've mentioned these 'friends' before, who are you talking about?"

When I was being contructed at TLI, one of the Shadow Mirrors deep cover agents made friends with me, helped me with my personality development as she worked on my data-gathering protocols. But then she was called away to her duty, and was secreted into the command crew of an EFA vessel. I believe she can get us this vessel, and rendevous with us after we've finished the attack. That'll give us a clear run to investigate this facility. We can meet with her, head there, check it out, and be back at the new base by dinnertime tomorrow.

"R-really?"

I guarantee.

 I'm all for attempting to get more ships/resources at the facility.

Simply because if it's legit, it's something we can't afford to pass up.

If it's wrong? Well, the Shadow Mirrors will have only lost 4 units. And they can fall back to the Grungust Neo when shit gets real.

 "Ok then, it sounds like a plan! We'll head there right after we kick some ass!"

Excellent! I'll make arrangements and then organise our battle strategy. This will be a glorious new age for the Shadow Mirrors.
Commander Lefina Enfield had stopped looking at the fleet report monitors. She knew that everything would be autocensored anyway, creating the illusion of a fleet that never did anything, when in actual fact it was responding to a dozen pocket wars at all times. And of course I have to open my big mouth to the wrong people, and get myself shipped to this glorified mail van.

The Eurydice, a Hiryu Mk2, was a step up from a fighter as a scouting vessel. It had minimal crew and a PT bay that was currently empty. It was a joke assignment for someone who'd graduated top of her class from Hawaii, but then, it wasn't skill that determined your place in the EFA Fleet, it was loyalty to those above.

Hence why that whippersnapper is captain and I'm stuck filing reports and pretending this fleet isn't a bunch of glorified thugs for the Geneva bigwigs...

"Captain on the bridge!"

Lefina leaped from the chair and fell into a salute despite herself. "Captain, all stations report situation normal!!"

The quiet, mousy voice again. "No, it isn't!"

"Captain?"

"Command has just informed me of a special mission we will be taking. It is top secret. There will be no communication off the ship without my express orders. Understood?"

"Er...of course, Captain." A special mission? For this ship? How?

Captain Marion Despinis sat in the vacated captains chair and whispered at the helmsman. "Lay in a course for LCO #288, in low orbit over africa. Cruising acceleration, be ready to engage Stealth Shade at my command. This will be our most important mission."

Looking back at thread 3, the best I could come up with is if Aussensieter and Autovajin from Faiz had a baby. Wheels attach to shoulders, Lanzekannones emerge from chest, forearms are enlarged to hold its Ridol weapons (two handles sticking out of each arm). Beyond that I had little.

This is actually a semi-decent point.

Presuming that Dumi is somehow part of Duminuss, which it may be, the R-verse Duminuss was a victim of circumstances and well-intentioned but was horrible at carrying those intentions out.

Our Dumi's acting too... helpful to be OG-verse Duminuss, so it's probably not that one.

Plus, remember the last guy who hid secrets from us that we then found out about? Kai? I mean, Kai's fairly on the level all things considered.

 When are we going to do crazy shit like this?

The Mission: sneak into the temple of a maniacal cult and rescue the virginal daughter of a CEO before she is sacrificed to a kraken.
During the infiltration, the intrepid group manages to 'borrow' some white acolyte robes for disguises. Clad in white from head to toe, they stealthily make their way through the twisted passages of the ancient temple.

From ahead one of the group hears muttering and they stop. It turns out they have reached the dining hall of the temple guards who are congregating for the morning meeting/briefing. As the group ponders how to go about passing this obstacle, one of them hears someone approaching fast down the hall towards them. The runners shrink back against the walls and, as the guard runs by, tackle him, incapacitate him, and then the Sam of the group (hereafter known as Mr. Bloodlust) chops off his head!

This minor commotion, though too quiet to be noticed in the meeting, disturbs a room full of 'sacred animals' being kept for sacrifices. In order to silence them Mr. Bloodlust jumps into the room and, using his combat axe, slaughters the twenty or more sheep. He does this with great abandon, spattering their blood and gibs all over the walls in the process (killing with a combat axe is MESSY).

After this little killing spree, Mr.Bloodlust leaves the carnage and returns to the group. As he passes by the body of the dead guard, he realizes he has a chance at a free weapon and, reasoning in typical sam fashion that one can never have too many guns/too much ammo, strips the cooling body of combat webbing (complete with pistols and grenades), and slips it on OVER his robes.

At this point, the group realizes that they have to pass through the meeting room in order to get to the remainder of the temple and complete the mission. 
Anonymous Sun 21 Feb 2010 23:58:41 No.4568958 Report

The voices from the guardroom have increased in volume as more people arrive. As the group stands around pondering their next move they hear someone in the meeting call out "Hey! Where's Abdul?"

Glancing down at the combat webbing name badge that says 'Abdul', Mr. Bloodlust gets an idea…

Of course, he consults no one else regarding this cunning plan.

He bursts into the dining hall and yells out, "Somebody killed Abdul!"

At this point, the GM stopped the game. As he puts it "I had fallen to the floor laughing so hard that I could hardly breathe!"

GM: "What the Hell were you thinking?"
Mr. Bloodlust: "Well, I figure they'll all want to investigate Abdul's death."
GM: "Okay, let's imagine this scene. An ork clad in the blood-drenched robes of an acolyte, bearing a bloody, gore encrusted combat axe and WEARING the combat webbing and name-badge of 'Abdul' rushes into a room full of security personnel and freely announces the death of somebody HE HAS MURDERED!
Mr. Bloodlust: (is quiet for a moment) "Ooops."
At that point, three other players passed notes to the GM stating they would take shots at Mr. Bloodlust during the ensuing battle.

Does it surprise you that the character didn't survive?
