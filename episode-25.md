 You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask, a frilly-dressed psycho on a mission to topple the corrupt Earth Federation and form a harem of OGverse Arado and underage girls. You'd just taken up the offer of your AI partner Dumi to visit a mysterious weapons factory beyond the moon, in the hopes of finding something to help the Shadow Mirrors return to greatness. 

 When you arrived, you found a series of mysterious drone mecha guarding the entrance. Dumi attempted to hack their systems like he does with everything else, but something has gone horribly wrong. Now Dumi is spazzing out and screaming "ODE!! ODE!!", while a flight of drone mecha bear down on the two of you, intent on your capture. 

 WHAT WILL KATINA DO?? Zeta Zaku Tue 23 Feb 2010 19:10:28 No.4581214 Report 
 Call for support fire and possible recovery by Despinis. We need to keep them from assimilating Dumi now, infiltration just dropped several rungs on the priority level.

 "Snap out of it you moron!!" you yell as you leap off the bucking motorad at the oncoming mechs. Plasma leaders snake out and grab the two drones, and they're slammed together, crunching into a single pile of scrap. Boosting towards the entrance, you see another half a dozen on the way.

"LIGHTNING FALL!!!"

The landing bay and the emerging mechs all liquefy as you rush inside, covered in a sheath of plasma. You ram through several walls and find yourself in some kind of loading bay. Sensors show a large open space beyond the next wall.

No! Katina, don't leave me!!

"Dumi? Have you finished spazzing out yet?"

I...I had to shut off my hyperwave communicator, to shut out the voices. I can't talk to Tis, Lalia or Despinis. I.....I'm alone, for the first time....

 The DGG-04 stumbles in through the melted tunnel, its shield repelling floating globs of metal, when suddenly its grabbed by something equally massive.

"It's ok Dumi, I'll never let you be alone. You're my partner, we're sticking together."

The DGG-04 relaxes in the Raiohs arms, then returns the hug. Thank you, Katina, that means a lot to me...Look out!!

The two of you dodge to one side as streams of missiles fly through the landing bay. A dozen of the drones are entering the area, weapons out.

Be careful, Katina. These Bartols are controlled by a network of minds which have been linked together with alien technology. You won't be facing 1 pilot, but hundreds, in each one.

"My kinda odds. Lets go, partner!"

Raiohs weapons
Harken Impulse - A kick that shoots lasers
Plasma Leaders - Electromagnetic whips on each fist, used to grab enemies. You're supposed to pull them towards you and kick them, but we've been more experimental
Lightning Fall - Rider Kick!!! The plasma explosion covers a wide area.
Rising Meteor - Beat up a guy, toss him into the air, then do a focused plasma kick on him.

Dumis weapons that you know of
Lanzekannones - beam guns on Dumis chest
Ridols - Liquid metal weapons that can form swords, axes, whips or pistols
General Blaster - Big shoulder beam cannons
Attack with some german name another guy came up with - Detach the shield generators on the shoulders, charge them up with energy buzzsaws, and use the ridols to use them to beat the shit out of people.

 You both charge forward, weapons blazing. The Harken Impulse takes out three before they can so much as turn their heads.

Then they start dodging.

"Ok, then try this!!"

You start pumping the Raiohs fists, and bursts of electromagnetic energy fly from the Plasma Leaders. Bartols are flung like ragdolls, several crashing into the ones coming in through the doors. More explode than you'd expect of properly built mechs.

Then they start dodging again.

Katina, killing them is pointless. There are over a thousand in the facility, and each one you kill is a mistake the ODE system won't make again, we need to make for the core of the asteroid, where the central system is located!

 Can we infect them with a virus? Make it so instead of transferring battle data every time they communicate with each other, their memory is wiped. Since they're a hivemind if we can infect even one then it will spread throughout all of them incredibly fast with no defenses. (this is why genetic diversity is important in the real world, kids) 

Else just RAIOH KIIIIIIIIIIIICK through the walls to the central core.

 "Ok then!" You rip up a large chunk of deck plating to give yourself cover. "Take us there!!"

Ok!. Dumi fires a full burst of shots into the wall as he transforms. You leap all as he engages thrusters, and you go careening through the wall.

As the cloud of shrapnel clears, you see nothing but white. Looking left and right, you realise the centre of the facility is a massive white sphere of metal, with only a thin layer of rock around it. It's a massive construction, easily on the scale of a colony. How it was made undetected you have no idea.

Shields are down...Theres a crack in the outer hull there!

Unfortunately, a squad of Bartols is flying up from the surface, between you and the obvious entrance.

 "Full Boost! We'll break through this!" You snake out the Plasma Leaders again, into the middle of their formation, and the Bartols scatter. You snare one and draw him in to be dashed against Dumi's forcefield, which is now under heavy fire from its friends.

This level of attack would be murder against PTs or AMs, but I can handle it. 

You sweep down to the surface of the sphere, trying hard to ignore the readings of more enemies on your tail. You find the crack Dumi mentioned and zoom inside.

The interior of the thing is bewildering, it's like nothing you're seen before. All manner of arcane devices flash by, none of which you can even begin to guess the function of. You pass by a storeroom filled with hundreds of giant metallic insects and some kind of knight-like PTs, and another were the Bartols are being put together from pieces being poured from moulds.

"What the...?"

This facility wasn't built by human hands, but somehow, these people have gained control of it. I couldn't have guessed...

Then your external comms light flashes up.

 "Heh....heh-heh!!"

The old man's voice is more guarded. "Whats so funny?"

"Another old fool, who think he can unite the world..."

"What?"

"You think you're all that original? People have been trying that shit since the stone age, buddy. It doesn't work. Mankind doesn't unite, its not in his nature. Man is a fighting race, and that's why its so great."

"Wait, what? What madness is this?"

"The madness of the truth of man. That men and women only meet their true potential when they're fighting, that cultures only mature through war and catastrophe. Man may be mad, but its a glorious madness. My kind of madness."

"Who the hell are you people?!?!"

this is flamoot. it's 2010 and i have a brain implant because i use drugs. i know how this sounds. but stories of going schizo from hallucinogens are only myths

lsd and shrooms etc are as mind opening as the rumours say, but it is a big secret because the government is performing crowd-control on the people who know about them. on the number of psychedelic users in society... they can only handle so many of those kinds of people. but psychedelic users are mostly young and hip and feel things deeply and are thus perfect victims for the very evil.

if psychedelics were allowed to spread through the population at the natural rate, people would become impossible to control in the painful and bizarre ways they control us. this includes brain implants. tear-away children of nobody families are isolated and disconnected over the course of a few years and then given implants that let the rich wear their skin like a suit. think one in a million. and god. believe me

don't automatically trust anyone telling you to go as far out as possible, to escape society and your ego and this sort of thing. what cults do first is try to create an intrapersonal vacuum they can fill with dogma. they are using the psychedelics for this now

the psychedelics produce very real and powerful experiences you don't need to have explained to you repeatedly if you have used them a few times. no-one has to preach ego death to an acidhead. he knows about it.

a lot of cults offer up a lot of junk but the psychedelics are real and they produce the most powerful experiences in the world. they can be used to free people and heal them but, the elite are holding them from us like the priest class once hid the psychedelic sacraments of the mystery religions so they could have a monopoly on god. it is the exact same plan

and just like the priests got a ton of kids to screw for thousands of years, so do the people who've stolen the psychedelics, now. the government and the rich. i like people, i've never feared the rich... but this is serious

bear with me :|

>I am Katina Tarask and I do not accept defeat!

Like she's let that happen. She'd grab Dumi and kick an escape route through the base.

Or else fail and go all moe

>>4584552

I could see something like that working for a single scene. If she's at her limit and battered and seems to be broken ... but then she gets up and no matter what you can't put her back down? Someone advancing on you naked and bleeding but insane and unkillable... 

>Katina is out there. She can't be bargained with. She can't be reasoned with. She doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And she absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.

Or something. But for the whole story? That would just be too weird. kinda hot but too odd to work, no-one would take the story seriously any more. Ever. And I think we're all enjoying the story too much to spoil it for one vicarious thrill. 

Actually now that I think about some of the previous choices...

 "Like this?"

Like that.

"Ok! THUNDERSTRIKE TORPEDO!!!!"

You kick at full power into Dumi's forcefield, sending the Motorad form racing like a bullet into the final shielding layer. With a massive explosion Dumi bursts through. You fly after him, and find yourself hovering over the center of the sphere.

"Hooooolllyyyyyy...."

The Scorpion is massive, easily half as big again as your super robot. Its white-and-grey form exudes power. Its tail is buried in the heart of a massive orange sphere, covered in eye patterns, and festooned in lifeless wings.

This is it, the heart of this damned ODE system.

"Really? It looks like a cool mech stabbing a mutated orange."

The 'Orange' is where the ODE waves are coming from, but it not totally under Juergens control. The Scorpion is...stopping it, in a way. The energy of the Scorpion prevents the Orange from functioning, allowing Juergen to siphon of its power to run the system.

"Ugh....Ok."

From all sides, Bartols start to flood into the room. You think theres at least a hundred in the first wave, with more on the way.

Combat is meaningless, we sever the connection between the two pieces, we've won.

"So we just blast them?"

Forcefields on those things are even better than mine. We need to go direct to the source. Katina, I need you to get out of your mech, and into the Scorpion. Find the core of the Scorpion and....well, thats all you need to do, really. Just touch it. I'll handle the Orange

The Bartols are closing in, soon they'll be in striking range. 

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

 Thankfully, you already spend some time fitting your dress into your spacesuit before you left the Eurydice. It's not the most comfortable fit, but hey, its the only set of clothes you intend to wear.

Force that hatch open...Good luck, Katina.

"You too, Dumi!" You float into the hatch the Raioh is forcing open. You feel the vibrations of missiles hitting Dumi's extended forcefield. You may not have much time.

You climb into the hatch and through the tunnel. The walls are lined with alien crystals, glowing with subtle light, which goes dark as you put your hand near it. You clamber up into the central chamber.

Inside is a young woman, seemingly asleep, floating in the middle of the chamber, attached to the roof by gossamer cables and her extremely long red hair. She is dressed oddly, but she looks incredibly human.

You hear rumbling outside. That can't be good.

WHAT SHALL KATINA DO?

Should have left them in the Eurydice. If the Bartolls reach us, then the dress is forsaken.

 All of the above at once.

Rip her out of the damn thing, and while you're running back to the Raioh, make sure you're carrying her in a way that allows the maximum amount of feeling her up while you escape. In every possible place.

Then when you're both in the cockpit, make sure you specifically seat her on the most phallic looking piece of whatever you can find, and let the cockpit's vibration do the rest through her clothing.

Bonus points if she orgasms as you burst out of the flaming explosion of the White Star.

Oh? I was under the impression the Direct Motion Link wasn't part of the Raioh deisgn, and they added it in Alpha 3 when Touma couldn't handle the LIOH system. Even if this Raioh does have the Motion Link System, there's got to be a ridge or something near the edge of the cockpit.

...Oh well. In the event this doesn't come to fruition, make her shut up. With your lips.

And then feel her up on the way to the cockpit. We can save the fun stuff for later, when she's back on the ship with us.

I'd assume that it's a physical connection to the body, but seeing as it was eventually used in tandem with the Direct Motion Link system, it might be some kind of signal that gets sent into the brain via wireless signals.

Is there an atmosphere outside? If there's no air outside then we need to take this mech or leave the girl. Dumi can't remote control things right now so either he needs to teach us what to do or we need to get the girl to do it for us.

 "Wh...What the heck are you doing inside that thing, Dumi?"

I'm sorry, I had to reclaim my original body. My mission...my creators commands are still paramount. I couldn't complete my task as simple old Dumi...

"Original body? I thought...You said you were part of a stolen DC project, loyal to Shadow Mirror. Dynamic Unflexible Militialiser...um..."

Dimensionally Unlimited Multiplexity Intelligence for Nullification and Assimilation of Sidereal Spaces. Or Duminass, for simplicity.

"But...but..."

You can still call me Dumi! I'm totally ok with that! I think I prefer that name, frankly.

"So you...you're like the Irregulars? You just came here to fuck with our world?"

No no no! I...I was SENT here, my creator gave me a powerful overarching objective. I'm just...looking for something, and a lot more subtely than those Irregular idiots are going about things. But, Katina, really, other than my origin, I haven't been lying to you! I'm still your partner, amn't I?"

We trust Dumi.

We only kill people we care for if they decide to jump ship and fall in love with dirty sluts. Dumi's stuck by our side through thick and thin. Yes, Dumi lied about where she came from, but she stuck with us.

She stuck with an insane, bipolar girl with obsessions about getting little boys to wear dresses and never complained. That's the kind of camaraderie you don't get from most *humans*.

Well, I divided this story in 3 parts:

Begining part, from the initial battle with Beowulf's elites to the meeting with the DC.

South America part, from the battle where we abandoned the drillgust to Axel's awakeningg.

EFA's downfall, from our arrival into space to the death of Beowulf.

If each arc is approximately 6 threads then:

Arc 1: The Start, Arado's capture, the Bathroom Incident
Arc 2: The first set of Other People Quests, The Trip to Brazil, the Battle over the Gulf.
Arc 3: Mardi Gras, Death of Ensign Mickey, Shine's Capture.
Arc 4: Arrival in Africa, Battle at the Earth Cradle, Battle against Cry Wolves and Hagane, This trip into space.

That's very rough but its what you'd have to take as the basis.

I want to trust Dumi, really but:

1. It seems likely he (Is Dumi still he? Duminas is always referred to as she...) has really been working against us all this time.

and 

2 Probably for Dark Brain.

So who is Dumi working for?

Does Dumi *want* to work for that person.

What is he going to do with us?

What is his master going to do if he gets his way?

Also be in dere mode.

 I'd say that we should trust Dumi at least for now, but make it clear that if we have to choose between the Shadow Mirrors and Dumi, we'll side with the people whose cause we believe in.

As long as Dumi's actions don't threaten our world, I think we should take a policy of neutrality regarding his search for whatever it is he's looking for. Also, dereface.

 "Y...Yes Dumi, you still are. You've stuck with me this long...longer than anyone else I can remember..."

Thank you, Katina. I promise, I'll be completely truthful with you from now on.

"Well, in that case...Who is this creator you keep mentioning? He seems kinda important."

Urgh....Now, Katina, realise that I don't have any control over this, much like you can't control who your parents we-

"Who is it?"

...The entity the Irregulars called Dark Brain. He's not a very nice person.

"Isn't he supposed to be destroying their universe or something? That's a notch or two above 'not nice'!"

Well, technically, he hasn't done that yet because that's due to happen in the Irregulars future, which they've changed by coming here and altering things...But yes, he occasionally smashes up universes and throws pieces of them into one another to create horrific mashups.

"Why would yo-"

I can't not work for him, Katina! Obeying his commands is ingrained into my mind like breathing is for yours. I don't nessecarily want to mess with universe like he does. Thankfully, my mission really only involves finding a mech for him, a mech that shouldn't even be in this universe anyway. If I do it right, I won't have to hurt any-

 "Dammit girl, I told you to calm the fuck down! Does Katina have to smack a bi-"

Let her go, Katina.

"What? Why?"

I'd forgotten about this in the...excitement. Your presence will be extremely uncomfortable to her. Let her float free, and I'll calm her down.


*Oh...Oh my head....What in the world is happening bwahuhuhuh*

*I'm terribly sorry, young lady. You've been through a horrible ordeal, but don't worry about it now. It's over, we've rescued you.*

*Wh-who are you? Where's my father? Why am I floating?*

*You've been kidnapped by people who wanted to use your powers. Don't worry, you'll be back at home as soon as we can take you there.*

*I don't understand!!*

*That's probably for the best.*
"Ok, whats with the moonspeak? And why did I have to let her go?"

Your talking loudly and slowly to her wasn't working that well. If she knows english waking up in an alien space station is too confusing to let her remember it. As for the other...Do you remember when I mentioned your unusual brainwaves, how they were rejecting all that mind-control stuff the School did to you?

"I..I thought you made all that up!"

Well I didn't. Your mind is naturally opposed to attempts to alter it, and that includes the mind-control circuitry that this white mech, and most of this facility, operates under. It was caught in stasis, and your presence acted like a circuit breaker, resetting the system.

"...I thought I said I wanted english."

if psychedelics were allowed to spread through the population at the natural rate, people would become impossible to control in the painful and bizarre ways they control us. this includes brain implants. tear-away children of nobody families are isolated and disconnected over the course of a few years and then given implants that let the rich wear their skin like a suit. think one in a million. and god. believe me

don't automatically trust anyone telling you to go as far out as possible, to escape society and your ego and this sort of thing. what cults do first is try to create an intrapersonal vacuum they can fill with dogma. they are using the psychedelics for this now

the psychedelics produce very real and powerful experiences you don't need to have explained to you repeatedly if you have used them a few times. no-one has to preach ego death to an acidhead. he knows about it.

a lot of cults offer up a lot of junk but the psychedelics are real and they produce the most powerful experiences in the world. they can be used to free people and heal them but, the elite are holding them from us like the priest class once hid the psychedelic sacraments of the mystery religions so they could have a monopoly on god. it is the exact same plan

and just like the priests got a ton of kids to screw for thousands of years, so do the people who've stolen the psychedelics, now. the government and the rich. i like people, i've never feared the rich... but this is serious

 we should bring a few mechs back so the shadow mirrors don't complain about us running off.

 You know what this means, guys.

Katina has to eat a demonbug and get some wicked tattoos.

Hmm...We're in space now aren't we?

Why don't we go find the Valstork?

You know what? Let's do this. Then we can make a dramatic entrance mid-battle when the SMs are getting their asses kicked by the EFA.

Seriously, I don't mind this solo Katina business at all.

Surely they'd be happier with the forces of hell. Contract some more demons and go find Lucifer, we're going Chaos route.

Pfft, fuck that. Alignment routes are for fucking pussies - we're going Neutral and kicking the ass of both Lucifer AND God!

Yeah, but Chaos is way more in-line with Shadow Mirror philosophies than Neutral. Neutral is mostly about trying to make both sides fuck off so everyone can live in peace. Chaos is much more about an eternal war for dominance. And face it, Lucifer would probably pull some TEST YOUR MIGHT bullshit on us anyway, so it's not like we don't get to fight him.

>Neutral in SMT3 eventually led to teaming up with Lucifer against God
The middle route means different things depending on the game.

And who says that the protag didn't choose to kill both of them because of BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD? And even if he didn't, SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE is only a short step away from 'everyone fuck off and leave me alone'...

...Reading that again, it doesn't sound as coherent as I hoped, but you get the idea.

Unless of course it's autosaging.

Which it is.

Damn.

Even if it's autosaging can you manually age it?

...no. Foiled again. What's the point of age then? ...It's not on the FAQ anymore... did I imagine it or is it a real thing.
