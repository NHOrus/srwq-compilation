SRWQ Mission 26: And now things get complex Sciencegar Sciencebolt Wed 24 Feb 2010 19:09:42 No.4588993 ViewReplyOriginalReport

 In our last thread, Dumi and Katina had infiltrated the Hellgate facility, smashed their way through the Bartols, and found the alien mechs that formed the core of the ODE system. However, once Katina had recovered the pilot of one such mech, she discovered that Dumi had inhabited the other, claiming it was his original body, and that he was actually Duminass, a servant of Dark Brain. He begged Katina for forgiveness, and in a tearful scene, she said he could stay on as his partner. Now they just have to deal with this facility they've ruined...

 The winged brain-like thing that is now Dumi looks out over the squads of inactive Bartols floating in the central chamber. Hmm...We have two major issues resulting from this. One is Dr. Jeurgens and his ODE system. Without my body, his systems network can't control the Bartols, its just a hivemind of normal humans. But I can't use the Bartols either, since that involves activating the system again, leaving me vunerable. If we intent to use these drones, then we're going to have to disconnect Juergen and his helpers, and bring the ODE system totally under my control.

You shrug. "Don't see what good they are, they're just cannon fodder."

A thousand mecha of any type is something to be reckoned with, particulary when the Shadow Mirror forces have less than two dozen currently. The other issue is the Neviim itself.

"The which?" 

This white sphere, the core of the asteroid. Its a giant alien factory ship, made for the mass-production of remote mecha and...well, I didn't get their full purpose the last time I was here. But, when you removed that girl from the main mech, A wing indicates the japanese redhead you rescued, who flinches,  You deactivated the stasis routines which kept most of the systems locked down.

"So you mean....the aliens are gonna wake up now?"

I'd imagine something is going to happen, yes.

DOES KATINA HAS ANY IDEAS, OR AT LEAST PRIORITIES?

This is quite obvious what we do.

We beat Juergen and take control of the Bartols. Then we strike a deal with the Aerogators about working together.

I figure they'll take it. They came because they wanted humanity to become strong weapons for them, and the Shadow Mirror philosophy of eternal war would help them get their goal with minimal effort on their part.

Bringing the Power of Love into this argument reminds me - we need a comparison of relationships, OTPs, etc. between the OGverse and SMverse, since several pairings are obviously different.

We've seen SM!Brooklyn and SM!Kusuha before, yet neither are quite attracted to each other just yet and the latter's more of a boozehound nurse than an on-again, off-again damsel in distress. (SM!Brooklyn don't take that "getting mind-controlled/captured" shit period.)

 "We should deal with the enemy we know first off. Where is Juergens?"

The ODE system connectors are scattered throughout the asteroid, but most of them are in a central tower built onto the surface of the Neviim. We can follow these cables to their source, and we should find Juergen there. Or...

"Or you can kill him from here with your alien mind powers?"

Or we could try talking to him. Juergen is obviously a genius to have figured out even a fraction of my technology. If we can convince him to our side, we could make an incredible ally. Not just him, but the Junkers faction who claimed this base. And...we may need the help if the aliens turn on us.

 Juergen yells, both with his real voice and the one inside the system, as the DC staff abandon their rest pods and head to the evacuation areas. "No!! Don't leave, we need as many minds as possible to fight them off! Only by uniting with the ODE system can we hope to triumph!!!"

You're quite the one-horse pony, aren't you, Dr Juergens?

"You!!...Please, this is my lifes work, it can save humanity from itself. Don't take it from me!"

I don't see how linking the minds of people into one homogenous mess can be that useful, but, I am willing to compromise on your existence. I want allies, not war.

"What...What is your plan, Core?"

My name is Duminass, and right now, my plan is to stay safe from the Balmar that are waking up.

"The ones in suspended animation? Oh...my..."

Allow me root access to the Bartol control system, so that you can't turn on me, and I'll return the ODE system to you. We can then coordinate a defense together.

"....A-alright...but will that be enough?? The alien forces....They far outnumber what we were able to make, even with control of their factories."

Juergen will help for now, I have him trying to get a signal to the Junkers Faction. Now we need to make a desicion about the Aliens.

"Ugh, like, to kick their slimy green butts or just to set them on fire?"

It's a little more complex than that. The aliens are alien in...the not-from-earth sense. At least, some of them...

"Huh?"

Hold on. Dumi starts yammering in japanese again, to which the redhead answers haltingly. You float there as the two converse, fidgeting to try to make your rolled-up skirt comfortable inside your spacesuit.

It seems Mai here has no memories of anything happening since she was captured from...Japan, several years ago. Yes she was piloting the core mecha of the Neviim, the central piece of the Balmar hierarchy, and when I fought her before, she was quite convinced she was Levi Tolar, Mistress of Judecca. I would say a large segment of the Neviims crew may be similar captured humans. And, some of them may have been freed as well

"Wait...so...are there any aliens or aren't there?"

I don't know. Perhaps we should find out...

Either way, if these are anything like the Balmarians we know, freeing prisoners will likely be impossible. We may as well go in and make for wherever the Junkers faction has set up shop, if we can get a location. See if Dumi can pull up anything on the layout of the facility, Neviim or Hellgate.

 "We gotta find the humans...Are there cables leading to them too?"

Not that I can detect...nor that I'll be able to find easily/

"Why not?"

I suppose I should start from the start...This Neviim arrived in your system years ago, hidden inside this non-descript asteroid, and I was teh only entity to detect its arrival. I investigated and found the Balmar, but they attacked me with full force. I attempted to stop them by destroying the core of their system but the Judecca used Mai's powers to freeze both my body and the Neviim in stasis. Now that we've broken that stasis, the automated systems will start looking for me again. I don't want to risk anyone getting caught in the crossfire, look what the last battle did to this place.

You recall the cracked and cratered surface of the white sphere, and the massive voids you travelled through to get to the core, only partly repaired by the DC. "Right, so...I should go alone to look?"

I'm sending the Bartols to search as well. There are two main areas they can't break into though, we'll need Raiohs strength for that.

"Right!"

You climb back into the Raioh and head for the crossroads that lead to the sealed areas.

 After a bit of pounding, you crash into the smaller room, and find yourself surrounded by PT-sized mecha, in the green knight-esque design you saw on your way in. They seem to be inactive, except, for a small group in the corner, in slightly larger blue mechs. It seems they were also banging on a wallpanel with all their might.

The group turns to you and start waving the hands of their mechs frantically, in what you intepret as pleading motions. One of them appears to be exiting his mecha, revealing a man in unusual ornate armor, which appears to be attached to his body in places.

"Any other groups of humans about?"

"I...honestly couldn't tell you, miss. Last I recall, I was flying my Gespenst against one of the PTX girls in a trial, then I woke up in that room with all this itchy stuff stuck in my skin."

Katina, we have an issue.

"Dumi? I just found the first batch of humans, what have you found?"

It seems the other area was the Balmarian sleeper storage, and its finished defrosting. If these readings are right, there's something like 20,000 aliens waking up and heading to see what's going on. If we're going to act, we don't have a lot of time.

 "Oh, dammit! We'd better book! Can you guys fight in those things."

Kar-Wai nods on the comm window. "We seem to be linked to them somehow, even though only a few of us have implants. We're not all trained pilots, but, it seems the aliens stuck us in these things for a reason."

"Right. I'll get you all back to the ship. Dumi, is Juergen leaving?"

He's being a slowpoke about gathering equipment, but he's moving. The DC are unpacking their ships, they should be ready to leave within the hour.

"Wait, we have an hour?" 

We have an hour before the flesh-and-blood aliens can get themselves organised. The auto-defenses may not be such late risers. An hour to move 487 people into long-disused ships is actually fairly fast, you have to realise. These aren't Shadow Mirrors vessels, made with speed in mind.

"Ugh...Ok..." You look back down the chamber. There's definitely a lot more blocks to this section, and you can't rule out there being more humans. On the other hand, you're not sure you'd want a fight in here, especially if these immobile units become mobile.

Engage the Machine Cells at maximum strength.

"If becoming a monster is what it takes to save these people, than I'll become a monster. I'll rip, and tear, and slaughter everything in my path! I'll carve out my future, with my own two hands!"

Followed with the Machine Cell mutated Raioh returning that kick tenfold, from twenty different directions within five seconds using your newly crafted Rising Meteor.

"I am Katina Tarask, the Furious Thunder! THERE IS NOTHING BEFORE ME WHICH HAS NOT BEEN KICKED!"

 "Dumi!! How do I make the Machine Cells turn the Raioh Uber?"

...What?

"Like they did to the Grungust Type 3, made it into that awesome Thrudgelmir. How do I get them to do that?"

Katina, you specifically asked that I not let them do that.

"I know, but then this PTX bitch got in my way! I need to show her up!!"

*Sigh* Katina, the machine cells are a hodge-podge stopgap I had Tis put together using the remnants of the Earth Cradle experiment and some Dark Brain technology, in order to fix Sophia Nate and Wodan Ymir. They're nowhere near as powerful as we've been pretending they are, not without major energy input. Energy input you've been sucking up with all the repairs you've needed recently.

You fend off the glowing Slash Rippers and block another kick. "What...what kind of energy? Can I plug myself into the mains here?"

You'd either need me to charge them up directly, or to an accumulation of negative emotions on the scale of a small war. And no, your supposedly infinite rage is not enough.

The Raioh and the Gespenst perform a cross counter, both units stumbling back. "I....see. Kar-Wai, what the heck are you doing?"

"R-right! Hackman, seriously, get a grip! Why would us humans fight each other when these aliens are here? Are you really going to ally with them?"

The glossy grey-black Gespenst picks itself up. "I...don't have a choice! I've seen what happened to them, their tragedy, their loss, I can't see that suffering and sacrifice and stand idly by while they're killed for 'security' and 'the public interest'! My mother didn't raise me like that!"

MEANWHILE, WHAT IS KATINA DOING?

 Lightning streaks out of your hands and grabs onto the Gespenst, hauling it into the air while you pour on the volts. "Did your mother also tell you to take it in the ass from alien gangrapists, you stupid whore?!?!"

The Gespenst strains against the electromagnetic force, then its chest opens. A beams of energy pours out of the gap and into the Raioh's face. The Plasma Leaders close to prevent feedback from melting them. 

The Gespenst crunchs to the ground near where Radha and Tyutti are retrieving an oddly-dressed Jennifer Fonda. Hackman groans. "Won't work...Computers run on crystals now, not microchips....damn, I feel all tingly..."

Kar-Wai grabs the Gespenst from behind and holds its still. "Dammit, Hackman! Will you stop babbling!?! What is this shit about the aliens being refugees? I have metal embedded in my skull, is that what refugees do?"

"No, you don't understand... I was negotiating to get you turned back, all of you. They made a mistake, they didn't know what was going to happen. The disaster on Balmar changed everything. I saw it happen, dammit! He ate them all!!!"

Actually most of advocated shouting back at her to look at the prisoners and atrocities the Balmar commited. Then if she didn't snap out of it to beat the crap out of her.

I'll point out Hackman isn't struggling against Kar-Wai's grip, she's just saying wierd stuff over the comms. It looks like that shock took more out of her than she's letting on.

You did not read the rest of the post. She is way too out of her mind to reason right now. Besides, the grip Kar-Wai has on her won't possibly hold much longer and will end up with her attacking us again.

That's why I say that zapping her and then asking her questions in a safer place without her possibly attacking us with a Gespent seems like a better idea.

 "Ok, start explaining things to us dumb mortal, bitch, or I'll give you another zapping. What the hell is going on with these aliens?"

"They...They're called Balmarians. This Neviim is like a portable outpost, they were using it to check out Earth. They stayed a few lightyears away and they'd capture the odd person to get a measure of us. One day their bugs found Kar-Wai and me on an exercise. Scooped up his Gespenst and my Wildschwien and took us here. But apparently I was a particular type of sample, a 'psychodriver', they said, and there was a call from home base to send one back, so I was brought to Balmar."

"This sounds very wholesome and innocent so far."

"Shut up, I'm getting to it!! Anyway, I was on their planet a while, the ones on the home base were a lot more reasonable. They were saying that maybe they should make contact with Earth, form an alliance, or something. But then....him, the black thing....he rose up..."

"From where, a hole? His bed? Could you be a little more specific."

"....He...he was darkness...He covered the whole planet. I could hear them screaming in my head....He was eating their souls!."

"....Errr..."

"Only a few ships made it away, only about 20,000 people altogether. The only place to store them was here, on the storage deck. We put them in stasis pods and tried to plan a way to resettle them somewhere safe. The other ships went out, trying to find a safe place, but none of them came back. Laocidea said the only option was to negotiate with Earth, so we flew in...and then, there was a battle...People said it was another entity like the one from Balmar...We were on full battle alert, they said it was breaching the core. I was about to head out when...something happened....I remember being frozen....Then the new battle started..."

RESPONSE TO THIS?

 Fight time is over, talking time is now. Inform the woman that we have no intention of killing people unless they attack first. And before she asks we assumed she was with the bug things that shot at us, not our fault (even if it is).

See if she can get us to the leader of whoever's waking up.

Honestly, that description sounds a lot more like Keisar Ephes. I'm guessing Shiva just decided to screw waiting for an awakened psychodriver, he was taking Ruach out now, with the small side effect of waking up Keisar Ephes. Everything then went to hell.

They just have to realize that the EFA is ruled by monsters that seek to erase all humanoid life in the universe to realize that the DC and SM are more reliable choices.

Which is why I'm saying that we should explain the situation down on Earth, so that the Balmar will negotiate with us instead.

But also remember what the DC is there for. We may have some trouble convincing them not to attack the Balmarians...

Well. Either she's lying or decieved, Dumi saw the White Moon and instantly thought 'Oh god this will be Alpha all over again' and went all preemptive self-defence. Hell, it probably WOULD have been Alpha all over again if Balmar hadn't gotten their shit ruined by Kaiser Ephes.

Worst case scenario - Dumi was working with Dark Brain. It was not Kaiser who fucked up Balmar.

But I really hope it was Kaiser. Because that would mean we'd get to join up with the OG Numbers to wreck his shit, and that's always fun.

 You set your face glumly. "Ok, ok, maybe we got off on the wrong foot here. We'll go to see the alien boss, and try to talk this out. We might be able to get this figured out without killing everything."

Hackman is still silent. 

Kar-Wai calls you on the comms. "Uh, Ms. Tarask, my mech is giving me a funny readout from hers. I think....she's fainted."

"OH FOR FUCKS SAKE!!!"

Calm down, Katina, we can still negotiate with the Balmar. I'll just need a little while to assimilate their language and comms protocols from the Judecca, and I should be able to...Hrrmm.

"Hrrm what!!? Dumi, stop being so damned vague!"

Several groups of Bartolls are being engaged by the enemy drones. My computing power is being used up trying to hack the Judecca, I can't replicate the ODE learning system like the DC Hivemind could. And they have problems of their own.

"Dammit, what the heck do we do?"

This whole situation is escalating rapidly, Katina. I think the negotiations will have to wait until we're clear of the Neviim and can talk over the intervening distance. If we stay here and keep trying, the risk of the Balmar acting rashly will be very great.

"Fuckballs..."

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

 "OK people, we're getting out of here. Starbuck, take the Gespenst. Radha, let Jennifer into your cockpit. We're getting out of this hellhole!!"

You lead the charge through the winding corridors, following Dumis instructions for the safest route. Even so, you come across the remains of bugs and Bartolls everywhere, and even have to smash a few stray bugs yourself. But you and Kar-Wai are easily up to guarding the others.

You emerge with a kick onto the surface of the Neviim, near to a Peregrine battleship still sporting long-defunct UCC markings. The Eurydice is full, Katina, you'll have to hitch a ride with Juergens.

"Dammit...ok, everyone get in!"

You fly into the docking bay of the Peregrine, a snug fit as there are several black Bartoll-esque mecha also sharing the space. You hear the Peregrines guns going off, then a rough jerk as it accelerates into space.

The losses to the Bartol force are unfortunate, as is the failure to recover all of the ODE equipment, but I think the Shadow Mirrors have profited greatly from this.

You sit back in the Raioh's control harness and smile. "Yeah...Shame about the DC though."

Yes, it appears we may have set Lily Junkers back many years of investment in that base. But she, like the rest of Earth, have bigger issues to worry about right now.

"Wait, you still haven't gotten ahold of the Balmar command yet? Dammit Dumi, you're supposed to be able to conquer planets and buttfuck dimensions, and you can't make a phonecall?"

Aside from the technical issues with the Balmar technology, I was more referring to the response of the other factions on Earth. Most notably, the two sides of the EFA. Given that one is an alien force itself, and another is a unit designed to combat aliens, I find it unlikely they'll be negotiating with the same platform we will.

"Then...I guess we'll just have to keep them a secret, won't we?"

That would have been an option...If there hadn't been a major mech battle with the Bartolls as we covered our escape. The EFA can't fail to detect that sort of thing. They'll be coming here, soon, and in force.

"....Dammit, why is becoming all-powerful so damned tedious?"
