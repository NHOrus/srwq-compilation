In our last terrible thread, we left Katina battling Einst, EFA, DC Bartols, the Earth Liberation Front, Vindel Mauser and the Ryukooh, and switched back to the DC base in darkest Africa, where the SRX team of Yuuki, Carla, Tenzan and Aya had assaulted the rest of the Shadow Mirrors to learn more about them. As mechs battled desperately around the DC base, a sercet team of cyborgs infiltrated the Shadow Mirrors ship to steal equipment and capture personell. And the only person who can stop them is a teenage boy that our heroine killed herself...

Unit-ST raises the dartgun at the screaming nurse, one eye on the victim, another on their primary target. Shine Hausen looked at the cyborg with relief, then over his shoulder with concern. The thing was had been Jo Shigeru risks a look behind it.

Unit ZX smashes into his face, sending his stun dart astray and the gun out of his hand. The two cyborgs pick themselves up as The Boosted Child steps through the shattered doorway. He nods at Kusuha.

"Don't mind me, I'm just a passing-through abomination against god."

Kusuha faints. The two cyborgs leap at the boy-thing.

WHAT WILL THE BOOSTED CHILD DO?

Arado catches both cyborgs in mid-leap, and slams them to the ground, squeezing at their necks until he hear popping noises. "You've done a good job, Dumi. This new body...it's all an undead monster could ask for!"

I do try my best. And its not like I haven't made improved humans before.

"More than improved, transcended! I'll be like a g-" The two booted feet strike Arado in the back simultaneously, sending him flying with artificial force. He lands next to the restrained girl in the red jumpsuit, and the unconscious guard beside her. With a hiss, the damaged cyborgs switch to backup oxygen supplies, and charge again. The bulkier one is headed for the boy, crackling with electricity, while ZX heads towards the restrained girl, knife in one hand, grenade in the other.

WHAT WILL ARADO DO?

Arado leaps off the floor and grabs the large cyborg. Lightning courses through him, but he is beyond pain. He twists, and the cyborg flies into his partner.

"I don't know why they want you, girl, but I don't intend to let them get you."

Shine strains against her bonds. "N-no! My future is with them! Let me goooo!!"

She yells as Arado picks up the entire bed, ripping it from the floor supports, and uses it as a battering ram to smash down the door, and escape into the hangar. Outside, Arado sees two more cyborgs, carrying off three unconscious forms, and firing back at armed crewmen as they head for the exit.

"NOOO! DON'T!!!" Shine screams as Arado charges on, taking a cyborg in the head as he leap forwards and throws the whole package. It drops Rio and Ryoto, as he kicks out at the other one. It no-sells the shoulder blow and swings the gun to point at the boy. With a blur, his arm comes up to block the gun, as he blurs forward to headbutt the thing. Already weakened by Ryo's gunfire, V3s helmet-face cracks, the tertiary eye popping out.

There are now 4 cyborgs around Arado. One, seemingly the leader, is picking up the bed the boy threw at him, along with Shine. V3 is backing off and crouching to leap. ST is moving towards the exit, and ZX has just pulled the pin on his grenade.

WHAT WILL ARADO DO? Theres a dim awareness of energy depletion, that all the stress of the fight isn't doing the Machine Cells any favors.

Thigns go into slow motion as the situation escalates. V3 leaps over Arado's head, headed for the main ramp. Hongo rips off Shines restraints. ZX throws the grenade.

Arado spins and kicks the grenade towards ST and V3, then he grabs Johnathan and tosses him at Hongo. The impact of the 40-year-old is enough to distract the cyborg enough to grab Rio and Ryoto and jump onto the bed. But Shine is already running, and Hongo throws Johnathan aside and draws his pistol.

The Grenade goes off. V3 and ST are engulfed in blue flame.

WHAT WILL ARADO DO NOW?

Dropping Rio and Ryoto, Arado kicks the gun aside, although the bullet grazes his leg. He throws out a big punch, but Hongo manages to roll with it, and throws out a leg to trip Arado up. Arado stumbles towards Johnathan's body, and then rolls aside as the cyborg jump away firing. It makes it halfway to the ramp, where it picks up Shine and the 4 badly wounded cyborgs rush outside.

Arado stands up, noting the energy drain in his artificial muscles and organs. He's breathing heavily, something he didn't know he'd need to do anymore.

I think you did pretty well, considering your regeneration wasn't fully complete.

Arado ignores the voice, and checks the fallen ones. They all seem battered and bruised, but otherwise fine. Rio stirs and lifts herself off the bed.

"A-Arado...?"

The Boosted Child starts worse when he'd been electrocuted a few minutes before. "H-how do you know my name?"

The Soldifat boosts skywards, firing off missiles at those damned artillery mechs as it seeks the black shadow.

"I wasn't just seeing things, was I? That thing was real, it was th-"

Arado's suspicions are confirmed as the black WildWurger rises in of the Soldifar and jabs out with the Beetle Crusher.

Hitting the rear boosters, the Soldifar spins through the Crushers grab area and back to the ground. Arado raises the beam machinegun. "Where'd you get the Wurger? Did you steal it from the California base?"

"...It is you."

"You're that Black Knight character! Why do you keep following me?"

The StealthWurger lands in front of the Soldifar, in a relaxed yet mobile stance. "Don't you recall anything, Arado? What we had together? Have you forgotten completely?"

"Oh...Oh man lady, you've got the wrong guy."

"Don't call me lady! We were lovers, Arado! Did they take that away from you too? All those precious memories?"

"Oh no, no no, not this! You've got the wrong Arado, Ouka! I'm with the Irregulars, I'm from a totally different world! In my world, you were just my sister, nothing wierd like that happened!"

The Wurger stops a moment, then the Crusher opens again. "Maybe you are. Or maybe you're lying. Either way, I have to take you back. Seolla!!"

"Whu-" Arado spins around too late, and armor-piercing shells tears through the Soldifars legs. It comes crashing to the ground as the StealthFalken lands atop Trilobite 2.

The whisper comes over the comm. "Was that good enough, sister?"

The Soldifar squirms in the Wurger's grasp. "That was perfect, Seolla. Absolutely perfect."

The remains of the Snake, now squirming along like a worm, flops down in front of the Snail's cracked shell, with the Bat hobbling in behind. Ruined Bartols lie everywhere. One twitches, and then is crushed by Albero's Gespenst. The one-armed, bleeding mech and the remainder of its squad stand before the corrupred Chokijin, battered by still alive, as alive as things like that can be.

"You know, I'm almost looking forwards to seeing you again, guys. You really make things interesting for a jaded old soldier like me."

Kai manages to raise the head of his busted Gespenst. "Dammit, why can't you just go back to the hell that you crawled out of?"

"Actually, thats exactly what I'm doing. Later, Kai. Don't let anyone else kill you."

And in a flash, the monsters and the mechanoids are gone.

The dragon-thing lands before your drained Raioh, looking where the things had been standing. "So...the Guardians of this world were corrupted by the Einst...That must be why they're able to work so freely here."

"Yeah...Kusuha, what do we do now? All I know is that we're in China, can you contact the others?"

"Now hold your horses, kids." The Ashsaber lands atop one of the new hills in the area, dislodging an alien corpse you'd splattered against the rock. Vindel seems almost cheerful. "I think you owe us some explanations. I'd like to know exactly what these 'Einst' are. But first..."

The Ashsaber turns to you. "Tell me, Raioh pilot, what exactly has happened to the Shadow Mirror?"

HEY SCIENCEGAR

Ideas for the Neo Gungrust, specifically about the chainsaw sword:

-If there are not already rockets planned to be installed along the center of the blade, add them. Further, there should be a secondary set of rockets designed not for continuous use, but for brief, extreme use, like overboosters or something. This would then be triggered upon impact with a highly armored target, or when hitting a barrier to attempt to break through.

-Add Alteisen-style bunker buster design to the teeth, with a single round loaded, as a single use per battle, very brief but potent amplifyer to the desructive force and wounding abilities of the blade (again, since it lasts for such a brief period as on full revolution, it must be triggered at the moment of impact, or while in contact with a barrier slated to be broken)

Basically, I'm trying to optimize our Gungrust's sword to tearing through armor/etc, moreso than Zengar's sword.

He might come asking for one if we make it good enough....

"He means compared to the things Bullet and Kusuha fought in their world." Kai has managed to get his Gespenst to its feet again. "Those things were an army, a force like they just sent here would have been nothing to them. But here, they hide inside mechs, they steal the identities of humans, and they rule with finesse, not force. If they've been here for hundreds of years with any level of strength, they'd have done much better for themselves. There must only be a few of them, a couple of smart ones that run things, manipulating things behind the scenes to slowly make the Earth, and the humans, dance to their tune."

Vindel nods. "Precisely. The EFA must be their masterstroke, created after years of struggling to unite earth, so that they can stabilise everything. They've been building our planet into a cozy nest, an artificial home away from home."

Kai grins. "You must be loving this, Mauser. You've finally gotten an excuse for all your anarchistic bullshit."

The Vaisaga's blade flashes, and chunks fly off the R-1. The EFA mech stumbles backwards, then transforms and flies off, the remaining EFA forces following behind it. Axel rests the Vysaga on its sword, and looks up at the retreating group.

"Dammit, they've got our people!!"

The Soldifar lies battered in the Black Knights grip, and the cockpit block of the Schutzwald in that of the R-3. This on top of the dissappeared Russel. Axel's heart sinks as he sees a Space Noah class rise up from the jungle to meet the escaping units.

"Dammit, who's still active? We need to pursue! I'm not leaving anyone else to the EFA dogs!"

"Trilobites are out of commission sir! There were EFA saboteurs, we'll need hours to repair the damage!"

"Irm here, Tesla Drives acting up."

"Iisaki. I've used my ammo reserves."

"Lamia here, in pursuit!"

"Masaki here, me and Ryuune will save Arado!"

"Luckfield here, I am up for running these beggars down!"

"Star Team here, we're low on ammo but we can back you up!"

"Ring here, Huckebiens still good, Jayce is looking for your spare Gespenst."

Axel smiles humorlessly. "Vysaga's not in the best of shape, so I'll just have to catch up...Wait, wheres that sniper? Subota, where are you?"

"Sir....Dumi has...changed!"

"What?"

"He's turned into something else...and I think he's going to give the Irregulars the Zweizergain!"

"Lamia, Star Team, Ring, get after them! The rest of you form up on me!"

Masaki breaks onto the comms. "Wait, what's this about the Zweizergain?"

"Shut up you green-haired idiot!! Dumi, what the hell are you do..." Rising over the Jungle, Axel see the true form of the thing that was once merely the DGG-04. "What...the hell are you?"

It's rather complex, but for now, I'll say I'm on your side still, I've just had to be coy over my origins. I'm as trustworthy as any of your other impromptu recruits.

"Really? What about the Zweizergain?"

The gambit hasn't paid off, I'm afraid. The Irregulars, like smart people, lay in wait for us to bring it to them. If you want it, you're going to have to fight them for it. I decided it wasn't worth my time to do so.

Axel sizes up the XN-Giest, and the 2 new super robots guarding it. "I'm a bit more tactically flexible..."

Frankly, I don't think the thing is worth any more fighting over. Its main purpose is interdimensional travel, and with conditions in the greater multiverse worsening, it can't even do that right now. It's essentially junk right now. It's no longer even a good bargaining chip, since you'd have to kill the people you'd be selling it to.

"And you think you can just go over my head and decide that?"

Helios Olympus and his friends are right there. The Zweizergain is between you and them. If you want it, go and claim it. I'll stay out the whole thing.

Real life swords don't fire fuckoff lazers.

You both missed the point.

For you to hit a target like the SRX accurately you would need to get close with the sword and cleave it.

But that will be difficult to do if the SRX does retreating shots with the HTB cannon or any other beam weapon.

Hence why I said, don't bring swords to gun fights. Range.

It would be wiser to try to shoot it with other weapons.

Except you seem to be missing the part where the sword cuts a hole in reality and neatly bisects the SRX at range.

I hate to break your bubble here, but you can't really do that with the HTB Cannon or it will probably explode.

And most of the SRXs really good attacks are melee-based, and it has a sword of its own.

But then that would basicaly be shooting lazers. See: >>4624681

Can the Valzy do that at range? Because it doesn't seem like it.

Well then. Still, the SRX gets a head start while the Valzy tries to approach.

Isn't the Valzacard faster than the SRX?

And besides, it can still fire capship-grade lasers. And EXANVASHOOT.

That counts for something at least.

Tell them that we are gonna give them the Zwei if they help us rescue our people from the SRX team. If they are hesitating tell him that one of their people is captured too.

Also no comment on lamia's boobs, it would be OOC.
