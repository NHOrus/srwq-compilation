## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 15: The Morning After

"Katina, get up!"

You are Katina Tarask, one of the few surviving member of Shadow Mirror, thrown out of The School for your rage issues and tendency towards molestation of the younger students.

"Get up! There's big trouble!!"

Ibis' voice is barely audible over the thumping in your head. You have a vague recollection of going to the Mardi Gras and being offered a 'health drink' by someone called Kusuha. The rest of the night is a blur.

"Com'n, com'n..." You stagger out of your room, your frilly red dress still in disarray from the night before. You're vaguely proud of yourself for not having vomited all over it.

As soon as you open the door, Ibis drags you out into the hangar, where a perplexing scene meets your eyes.

Echidna Iasaki, mistress of the mysterious W-Series, is pointing a gun at Kai Kitamura, the ex-EFA ace and eyepatched man of mystery, while Irm, your commander-in-theory, looks on in shock.

---

####Current Roster (This may become quite relevant later)

+ Katina in her Raioh
+ Dumi the very helpful AI in the DGG-04, a transforming motorbike.
+ Irm, completely out of his depth, in a red Gespenst Mk-IIM.
+ Kai, the guy everyone listens to because he's so damned manly, whose green Gespenst is being upgraded.
+ Ibis, artillery specialist and gun nut, searching the world for Sleigh, in a Schutzwald.
+ Russel Bagman, keeps the group together with with his Irish 'cop-on', piloting a completely normal blue Gespenst.
+ Latooni, cold calculating School Graduate, piloting a Soldifar.
+ Echidna Iasaki, commander of 'W-Unit', in a Rathgrith.
+ A half-dozen wierd pods called W-Series, including one that TOTALLY DID NOT TALK TO YOU DAMMIT. One may have to be used to pilot your stolen WildRaubtier.
+ Giado and Garnet, Shadow Mirror agents who run this secret warehouse/safehouse in the jungle near Brasilia. Have a baby together.
+ Axel Almer: The true leader of Shadow Mirror while Lemon and Vindel are missing. Currently unconscious after the Soulgain went two rounds with Beowulf, one with an EFA battleship and another with the mysterious Black Knight, and promptly shut down.
+ Lamia Loveless, another active W-Series, who was badly damaged by elite EFA mechs. The Angelg has been repaired, but no word on her.
+Brooklyn 'Sir' Luckfield: A chivalrous warrior of the Shadow Mirror, quite big into honorable combat and the warrior ethic. Pilots the Vysaga.
+ Dr Shuu Shirakawa: Self-styled Scientific Savior of Earth, creator and pilot of the Invincible Earth Liberation Warrior Granzon. Claims to be about to save Earth, but from what, and how, no-ones really asked him yet.
+ Ring Mao: Former PTX Team member, head of PT creators Mao Industries, and ally of Shuu.
+ Lenonjayce Starlord: Another PTX veteran, currently piloting a Tausendfuessler.
+ Johnathan Kazahara, Rio and Ryoto: Heads of the maintenance and engineering staff you have. Repairing all your mechs is tough work, but John is finding the time to design the Neo Grungust.
+ OGverse Arado, Seolla, Ryuune and Masaki: Desperate to find the Zweizergain and anything else that could lead Dark Brain to their world, you are temporarily allied with some of the invaders from another universe. Relations are friendly for now, but oh-so-confusing, especially for poor Arado.

---

"What is... whu's... HWOOOORRFFF" You hurriedly grab a nearby bucket and empty your guts into it. Thankfully, you didn't eat a lot last night, so you're soon finished, and nothing gets on your dress.

"Wha 'xactly's goin' on?"

Echidna didn't even glance at you, her eyes fixed on Kai. "Mr Kitamura is attempting either theft of Shadow Mirror materiel, or a coup."

Kai rubs his eyepatch in irritation. "That's just your interpretation, miss. What I said I was going to do was get some of our forces moving again. Waiting around here for all these busted mechs and dying pilots to get better will only increase the chance of the EFA finding us. Better that we get on with our mission, at least sending some of our people on to Africa, than sit here twiddling our thumbs."

"That is not your decision to make, Mr Kitamura. You are still officially a prisoner, and have only provisionly freedom by Lt. Irms request. The true decision on what we are doing lies with Major Almer, and no-one else."

"Kai, you're cool and all, but this is a no-soldier-left-behind kinda gig. We stick together in the Shadow Mirror, and if the EFA do come, we fight together to fend them off."

Kai looks over at you. He looks like he's dissappointed in you.

"Ok, fine. But I was just trying to ensure the mission goes ahead, and that some of us make it out if the worst happens. I don't want to end up going 'I told you so.'"

He turns around and walks over to Rio and Ryoto. Echidna slowly puts her gun away.

"Lt Irm, I still reccommend he be confined. He is a rogue element and should not be given access to our equipment."

Irm sighs. "He's with Ryoto, if he does anything truly opposed to us the kid will scream bloody murder on him. We should concentrate on getting back to fighting trim."

"...Very well."

Echidna walks back towards the medbay, her face expressionless as ever.

---

####ELSEWHERE

"Excellent work, Major Hausen. This report fulfills your mission objectives nicely, and without major loss of equipment this time."

"Thank you Director. The Stealth Shade on the R-Blade will only last a few more hours however, so I shall have to retreat via the river to avoid contact."

"Do so. And dispose of your prisoner."

"At once, director."

Kirk Hamill blinks at Yukiko Date as she closes the comms. "Do you truly beleive this mad story? Invaders from a parallel world? We haven't even seen this as being possible, and interdimensional energy patterning is one of our best-funded tertiary projects."

"It's been the Shadow Mirrors primary focus for some time, however. Their sudden lack of buildup after they and TLI pioneered the Earthgain series and the Assault Dragoons of Freemont is suddenly quite easily explained. And if they've attracted an elite assault force from another world, that would explain this recon picture, recovered from EFA forces taking on the Irregulars over the Canadian border."

Hamill blinks in surprise. "Units 1, 2P, 3P, and the R-Gun..."

"Michael Rosebush's story fits the facts quite well. These are alternate versions of our projects secret units, come to purge our planet of an alien influence that threatens them. Hence the evasive tactics, when a force like that should be able to crush the EFA quite easily."

"Well, I guess I have no choice to agree, but what does it mean for us?"

Yukiko Date rests her chin on her hands, and stares out into space. "The Shadow Mirrors have to be watched. Have Intelligence find an appropriate agent. In the meantime, these Irregulars must not come in contact with our forces. Give a general order to our personnel to go to ground and avoid exposure. We shall have to ensure that the only contact they have is with those forces allied with the Commitee."

---

"Hello, Echidna. How are things?"

"Why are you in the medical lab?"

"Well, I was just sorta curious about your W-series guys. The ones in the pods. You say they'll be joining us in the pilots deck?"

"The current allotment of W-series are rated for piloting duties under remote supervision. They are pod-only and will not be joining you on night-time excursions."

"Well, ok, but how are they as conversationalists?"

"They are pilots, not philos *With a phonecord, Katina. Just because you couldn't handle me having a life.* sk you to leave."

You quiver slightly. "Y-y-yeah, I'll go visit Axel and the chick with the big tits now."

You half-run out of the lab. You definitely don't here that sad chuckle in the back of your mind. It's just your hangover.

---

You enter the medbay proper, and see Axel unconscious in the corner. His vital signs appear low, but steady, and the squiggly line on the chart appears to be going up, so it seems he's out of danger, at least.

Your eye is drawn to the bed beside him, which is unmade, and you see the remains of a tattered green dress there. You pick it up and have a look at it: It's quite revealing, and made for someone with a much larger bust size.

"You can keep it, if you like."

You turn around and see a green-haired woman pulling on a pair of fingerless gloves. She's dressed in a non-standard Shadow Mirror uniform, and is observing you with a whimsical expression on her face.

"I won't be wearing it anymore. Maybe you can do something with it."

"Uh, ok, thanks. Wait, who are you again?"

"I'm Lamia Loveless. I'm a... friend of Axels, I'll be fighting with him and you to create a better world."

"Oh, cool. I'm Katina Tarask, I'm the teams crazy one. There's a WildRaubtier sitting out there with no pilot, it'd be better if we gave it to a real person than one of Echidna's pod-people."

"......Yes. I suppose it would. Well, I'd like to meet the others. See you around."

She walks off. You look around at Axel, then at the dress in your hands.

The penny drops.

"Wait a minute...those are Axel's clothes!!"

But Lamia is gone.

---

You walk out into the hangar, your mind a storm from all thats happened this morning. You still have a touch of a hangover, and now you're getting hungry. But at least you have a spare dress for Arado now.

Now all you need is his measurements and a sewing kit, and you're sorted.

"Hey, Katina."

You turn around and see Kai standing there, looking at you oddly.

"I thought you were the type for dynamic action, girl. I never thought you'd agree to sit here on our laurels while we could be halfway to Van Trans fortress by nightfall."

"And I thought you were meant to be on our side, Kai. Splitting our forces and leaving the wounded pilots in such a dangerous place? You'd be condemning Axel to die! And all the engineers we'd leave behind to fix the other Trilobite. I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid."

Kai crosses his arms and closes his good eye. "I had considered that, you know. And given the situation, I still think the risk of losing everyone if the EFA attacks us makes it worth abandoning the stragglers. Besides, our mission is too important for us to delay it. Even a few days might be critical."

"What mission? Are you that attached to Ryuune's task? She asked us to find ways to track the thing, not kill ourselves charging across the planet."

"...This is bigger than a friendly thank-you to the DC, Kat. You know it is, all of you do, but you won't admit it. We've been given a chance to truly affect this world, to break the EFA and get the right people back in charge, but we're squandering it here. We can finally get what we wanted, an end to those damned F-"

The alarm sounds across the hangar, as the voice of the operations officer cuts in. "Enemy unit detected retreating north. All fast interceptors, scramble immediately."

---

####MOMENTS EARLIER

Shine climbed out of the R-Blades cockpit, checking her gun as she went. Fully loaded. She looked down at where she knew her prisoner had gone. Bound hand and foot, Mickey had managed to crawl a short distance from the bloodstained grass where she'd interrogated him, over to the R-Blades torso. He lay panting next to the humming Stealth Shade, drops of blood and sweat travelling down his skin.

"It's no use, Mister, I can see your future, and you don't have one." She cocks the pistol.

"..f... figured... But a Shadow Mirror... knows how to die..."

"Quiet."

The shot rips into his left shoulder. The sound isn't the wet thunk she'd expected. It sounded like the bullet hit... metal.

And then she knew what was about to happen.

"...W-35... Initiating code ATA..."

Shine dives into the brush as the fireball burst around her mech. Looking back, she saw the scorch marks on the grass, and the buckled plating around the now-inactive Stealth Shade.

"fffffffFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU

---

Kai is already gone, hopping over to the Guarlion and entering the cockpit. You look about, and see Lamia hopping into the WildRaubtier, powering it up in the same way.

*Ready to go, Katina*

Dumi rolls forward in Motorad form, the Raioh perched on his back. Rungs pop out of the DDG-04s hull, leading to the open cockpit. You hop up, and are in the pilot seat by the time the two super robots are on the grass.

*How should we get to the target, Katina?*

"Take us up Dumi, I want to keep a close eye on those two."

*Very well. Engaging Motorad Surf mode.*

The DGG04 splits vertically and fold up into a floating platform, the wheel modules flying off and plugging into the side. With the Raioh standing tall, the whole assembly lifts off the ground and speeds after the other two mechs.

"Lamia, wasn't it?"

"Yes. Katina, right?"

"Make sure you keep a watch on that Guarlion. Kai is being wierd, and not in a good way. I'm not so sure we can trust him all the way anymore."

"Ok, but I'd be curious as to his reasons for doing what he's doing. Humans are complex creatures, it helps to understand their motivations."

"Yeah... well... I like simplicity."

Kai cuts in over the squad channel. "Enemy sighted, it looks like that R-Blade unit you got trashed back when we met."

Lamia clicks her tongue. "It might be the pilot Luckfield fought yesterday. She must have followed us."

"How? You got teleported hundreds of miles!"

"...O-oh yeah. I... guess she was part of the teleportation then."

"Just try to slow it down, Kai, we'll be there in a minute or two."

The sounds of railgun shots sound over the comms. "Hrmm... might be a little tricky. this one can certainly move. And with a pretty busted-up mech, I might add."

"Just make her dodge to places that are not away!"

More shots. "Yeah, this one has talent alright."

"Stop admiring her! She needs to be captured!"

"...I guess its too late to kill her. But I know a good way to disable her."

Up ahead, the spot on your screen where Kai is indicated turns blue.

"K-Kai?"

"Jet Magnum to the lower back, best way to stop any PT. I'll just have to improvise a little."

The Guarlion incribes a blue circle as it accelerates into the sky and comes back down again, breaker field engaged. The blue missile plunges into the jungle, jinking wildly, and theres a sudden burst of static over the comm.

"Kai!"

The Guarlion emerges from the jungle, trailing smoke and missing an arm. "She's VERY good."

"Dammit, just keep her boxed in! Once I get there she's toast!"

"Ok!" Lamia flies in firing missiles, while Kai, deprived of a primary ranged weapon, opens up with his machine cannons.

The girl voice screeches over the comms. "Not now! Not to the likes of you! My future doesn't have defeat in it!" The stolen railgun barks in the R-Blades right hand as the mech rolls away from the impacting missiles. Kai dodges the first few, but two slam into the Guarlions torso.

"Agh! You're quite the ace, girl, who might you be?"

"I am the Princess of Foretold Victory, and I don't need to chat to useless grunt like you!!" She dives through the undergrowth, still firing, but Kai manages to dodge this time.

"We've got one of the crazy ones...."

"We have to stop her now, she's almost at the river!!" Lamia shouts.

"Dumi!! Gimme a boost, I'm taking her out now!"

*A boost?*

"Figure something out!" you launch the Raioh into the air and lock the legs into Lightning Fall formation.

*Very well...* The DGG-04 transforms to mech mode, flies up behind you and engages its forcefield. In a perfect synchronisation, the field extends outward as you engage boosters, and the Raioh flies like a comet across the jungle.

The explosion rips leaves off the trees for half a mile, and leaves nothing standing within a hundred meters. The shockwave billows out, plasma searing off the R-Blades paint as the mech is sent flying.

It hits the water, it's left arm and leg shearing off from the forces its enduring, its weapons blown to the four winds, but its still intact, and its under the water now.

*I think that would have gone better if I had been the projectile.*

"Shutupshutupshutup!"

The Raioh makes a massive splash as it enters the water, putting out many of the forest fires the previous attack had started. You plunge down into the dark depths, seeking your prey, but you can't see the light of any boosters.

"Where in the hell..."

*She's drifting downstream, attempting to avoid detection by not moving.*

You surge through the water, and sure enough, you catch a glimpse of something hugging the bottom of the river. Its boosters light up as you approach, stealth no longer an option.

"Give it up girl. Surrender calmly, and I'll make sure you're treated right..."

"No! I'm no fairytale princess to be captured and locked in a tower, I'm the Princess of... oh god..."

"Huh?"

"My future... if I go with you... I'd rather die!"

She forces even more speed out of her half-dead mech, remaining tantalisingly out of your grip. she appears to be headed towards some kind of boat, heading downstream in a similar way.

"Guys, break ahead of her!!"

*Lamia and I are already in position. Kai has retreated.*

"What the heck is that boat she's heading to?"

*It appears to be a cargo vessel, 300m long, loaded with containers.*

"Right..."

"Get ready!!!" You boost the Raioh out of the water and into the sky, piroquette, and boost back down again, plunging into the water not twenty meters clear of the ship. The wave created rocks the ship mightily, and dozen of containers, unsecured on the normally calm waters of the river, are tossed over the side.

Through this storm of steel emerges the R-Blade, manuvering desperately to avoid the crates, and the incoming fire from Lamia. But with the R-Blade so badly damaged, she can only do so much. The mech kerangs of a container full of plant extracts and clay samples, and falls right into the arms of a waiting Dumi.

"No! Let me go!! This isn't my future, and it's not yours either!! Your future... your...

*Please miss, it'll go easier if you just cal-*

Shine piercing scream fills the comms.

It doesn't stop until she passes out just before you land at the base.

---

The unconscious pilot is bound and wheeled away under guard to the medical bay. Irm looks on after it, then turns as Kai dismounts the damaged Guarlion and starts talking.

"Well... guess I wasn't so full of shit after all."

Irm looks at the badge taken off the girls flightsuit. "Major Shine Hausen, SRX Project Auxiliary."

"The EFA's most top-secret division. Turn over the comm logs and I'll bet you'll find she's fresh after giving our location away. We've run out of time to wait, Irm. We have to get underway, some of us or all of us, it doesn't matter, or the EFA will be sending their top people here. By tomorrow morning, this place will be wiped off the map."

Irm grunts, and nods. "I... guess we don't have much option. But its going to be a complete withdrawal, Kai, no-one left behind. We move as one unit, even if we have to wait until they're rapping on the door of the hangar."

"Well then, guess we'd better get started..."

---

You sneak into the medbay, one of the few areas of the ship that's not a hive of activity, and find Shine strapped to the bed next to Axels, with a bored-looking guard sitting beside her. He doesn't even look at you twice.

Shine seems to be coming around, but theres a faraway expression on her face.

"Wh... what did I see? Was that even a future?..."

"Rise and shine, Princess Leia." You tug on one of her elaboate bangs to get her attention.

"AH!! Y-you!!! H... how am I not dead? I was going to self-destruct..."

"Well, you didn't, and now you're in my clutches." You grin.

She recoils from you as much as the restraints will allow. "Y-you won't get anything out of me! I'm loyal, I'm dedicated! I'll eat my own tongue before one word rolls off it!!"

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? As opposed to 'what would you like to do?', which we've already established in the past 14 threads.

"Yeah, we'll see how long that lasts. First things first: How'd a little girl like you get to be a Major?"

"I'm not a girl!! I'm the Princess of Foretold Victory!"

"What the hell does that even mean?"

"..."

"Whatever. Are you really from the SRX Project?"

"..."

You pick up a scalpel and start fiddling with it. Shine starts to squirm.

"Why did you follow us?"

"It was my mission."

"Did you give our location away to anyone?"

".....!" Shine twists her head aside as you toss the scalpel into the pillow. You're not sure if you were trying to hit her or not.

"Don't fuck with me, little girl, I went to the School. I know shit about torture the guys in the middle ages would shit themselves if they saw. A brat like you will snap like a twig."

The guard is finally paying attention to you now, and is looking a little worried.

DO YOU HAVE A NEW LINE OF QUESTIONING, OR SHALL WE DO SOMETHING ELSE?

Creepy sexual stimulation. Get close to her, and make her trust us.

Step one: Deny her humanity.
Step two: Ridicule her ideals.
Step three: Give her nothing to go back to.
Step four: Offer a small bit of kindness.

Sorry to call the continuity police, but this was the first time Katinas ever met Shine. The other times, she was fighting the OG people and Bullet. Katina has no reasons to want vengeance. Sexual dominance, sure, but not revenge.

"Your pathetic attempts at reverse psychology won't work on me! I'm the jewel of the SRX project and if yo-!" She rolls with the slap, so that she's barely scraped by your nails, but she shuts up.

"SRX Project! Bah! Bunch of propoganda, if you ask me. If they're such hot shit how come no-ones ever seen them? They say they beat the Inspectors, but not a goodamn picture of them has ever been seen. I bet its just a bunch of propoganda they came up with so girls like you could play pretend."

"I'm no mastermind or spy, but I'm good with blades."

"Y-you won't hurt me....that way...." Tears start forming at the corner of her eyes, but she blinks them away.

The guard is looking quite concerned now. "Miss, are you the actual interrogater?"

ANY RESPONSE TO HIM?

"What does it look like I am?"

"Er, well...it's just..."

"You think I don't know what I'm doing?"

"Well, she is just a gir-"

You vault over the bed and pin the guard to the wall, digging the scalpel into the noticeboard next to his ear.

"Would you like me to practise on you? Would that convince you?"

The guard can only manage some choking sounds in his throat. You pull out the scalpel, and turn to face Shine again. Theres a great big smile on your face.

"Now...where were we? Oh yes, who's coming to get us?"

Shine looks rather mor worried now. "I-I don't know, they didn't tell me about the operation afterwards. I-I was just supposed to return to EFA territory."

"I see. Would it be normal for them to attack us?"

"The SRX project doesn't deal with simple terrorists! We were put together to face threats to the entire Earth! Like the Aliens, or these Irregulars, not a couple of anarchists like you!"

"So what you're saying is...no-ones coming to get you?"

Shine doesn't answer immediately, her eyes defocus for a moment. Then the hard-bitten expression returns. "I'll be fine."

"Really?"

"....Ultimately, yes."

"But in the short-term?"

Shine starts to squirm again.

"Er, I-"

"Good!" You walk out of the room, leaving behind a crying girl and a very confused guard.

It's quite fortunate that you left when you did, as you can now see the wounded Shadow Mirrors, previously being kept in the outbuildings, are now being shuttled in. The PT squad is being redistributed, with each Trilobite taking some of the damaged and some of the fresh. Everything is a mess, and even just standing in the hangar, you're having to dodge rushing engineers and the odd cranelift.

You rush out of the Trilobite and head over to the Tausendfuessler in the middle of the field. The Granzon is being stowed aboard, next to a smaller mech covered in a tarp.

"Dr. Shuu! Why are you packing the Granzon away? Aren't we going to teleport to Africa?"

"I don't think that would be appropriate, Ms Tarask. Space-time distortion is a delicate art, and even with the Granzon and my intellect commanding it, its still not something to do lightly. Conventional travel will suffice, for now."

"Come off it, Doc. You just finally realised how close you were to teleporting Mexico to the Moon."

The new arrival is a silver-haired man, in his late 20s like Irm and Ring. He's wearing a very worn old-style EFA pilot jacket, and his face is set with an odd mixture of humor and accusation.

"You exaggerate as usual, Starlord. I am completely in control of the Granzons abilities, it's merely that those abilities are dangerous to some degree."

"Something Shuu Shirakawa made, dangerous? Heaven Forbid!"

"Shouldn't you be throwing coal in the boiler of this thing?"

"Something like that." The man called Starlord waves at you, and turns back to the Tausendfuessler, while Shuu returns to his notebook, of which he has three others in different pockets.

"So, everyone made it out ok?" Tetsuya looks tired on the comm screen, as does Lefina.

"So it would seem. The Kurogane and Hiryu made their breakthroughs with minimal damage, and the Giest has successfully teleported to Argentina. And most of our lost lambs have met up with the Shadow Mirrors, so only Latooni and Shine are unaccounted for."

"Well, things are looking better than they were yesterday."

"Perhaps. We still don't have any real leads on the Zweizergain, or if any of Dark Brains servants are active in this universe. We have to proceed with the real mission, hopefully before the EFA regroup."

Lefina nods. "Agreed, but, where shall we start?"

"Ratsel and Sanger have been in contact with the Neo DC of this universe, and they've given us some slight leads. Tetsuya, take the Kurogane to Aidoneus Island, and investigate the underground chambers. Lefina, theres a man in Canada by the name of Helios Olympus. He may have some clues."

"Helios...Wait, wasn't that...?"

"My name, yes. It could simply be an imposter, but we can't afford to pass anything up at this stage. I'll continue trying to make contact with the EFA and other factions, and see who will work with us. The others will be checking Africa, and the Earth Cradle."

"Gilliam, what kind of timescale do we have to work with here? How long do we have?"

"I honestly don't know. The Zweizergain could make the jump tomorrow, or it could wait in hiding for years, potentially. But we have more to worry about than that. Unless we can finally get in contact with the EFA and call them off, we will eventually be overrun and picked off."

(Yeah, that was pretty shit, but I felt there had to be some exposition from the OG guys. I'll try something more interesting next time.)

Thing is, it being the Huckey EX would be seriously weird, considering there was never a Huckebein Mk II to upgrade the original Huckebein's frame to.

Miami Auxiliary Base is considered by many in the EFA to be a waste of resources. Why put such a large base there, they say, when Langley base is a few hundred miles north? These people fail to realise that the whole point of MAB is that it isn't Langley, and thus things can happen there outside the eyes of the EFA top brass.

The Black Knight walks out onto the runway as the Tausendfuessler taxis to a stop. She flashes her ID at one of the staff, and tells him to hurry with the refuelling, as she hops aboard.

She finds the two mechs under tarpaulin, and the other pilot sitting in the hangar, eyes hidden by the shine of her glasses.

A whisper. "They've been covered in stealth coating. So the color will be right for you."

"I don't care much for the color, more the performance. Are these mechs really going to equal to the Schwartzritter?"

"I....I'm sorry. They don't have the multi-combat abilities. My mech is specialised for long-range combat, you have been assigned the melee specialist. I...I can recquisition more weapons, if you'd like."

The Black Knight smiles warmly, and places her hand on the other girls shoulder. "Sister, don't apologise for the shortcomings of the engineers. Radom Group has fallen a long way since they made the Schwartzritter for me, you can't be blamed for that. Besides, its up to the pilots to overcome the limitations of their mechs."

"Y-yes..."

The Tausendfuessler rumbles as it turns to face the runway again. "We'll be at the targets before you know it, so be ready. We'll find these Shadow Mirrors and that brat Shine, and even if we never end up fighting them, we'll be sure to find out every secret they're fighting."

Especially....if its really him...

The silver-haired girl nods. "Yes sister....I'll do my best."

Just cause they're both called Huckebein EX doesn't mean they're the same. Could just be Ring decided to customise the fuck out of the 008L on this side and called it EX just cause she wanted to.

Its cold in the pod. Really cold, so much that if his blood were meant to flow, it'd probably freeze anyway. He sort of wishes he could finish up here and go to hell properly, at least it'd be warmer there.

But no. They had to bring him back. Corpse was still fresh, they said. Minimal brain damage, they said. Fehu will know what to do. And ever since, the pod has been his prison as much as his useless corpse, the only outside contact being the pointless programming and....her.

I should get over it, he thinks. If I worry about vengeance, I'll end up as a ghost, walking the earth forever. Better to just do nothing and let them get bored, and finally switch the pod off, and let him rest.

Or you could try living.

Who?

I'm a friend.

Dead people don't have friends. How are you talking to me?

You're not truly dead, W-BC-01. It's just that the world, as it is, can't make you truly alive again. But I can.

What?

Egret Fehu may have been able to save your brain, and Lemon Browning able to coax you into a semblance of life, but theres an essential element missing from this world that would make you complete. I can help you find that, and bring you back.

Sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?

A fairly high one, for you.

I'm dead. How can it get any worse for me?

If I find a way to revive you, you have to promise me you'll leave Katina alive.

...That is a tough one, but I'm that vengeful a ghost.

...And, if I deem it nessecary, you'll have to leave her side, and come with me. Niether revenge nor reconciliation will be yours, if she's uncooperative.

....Damn you! Damn you!!

Those are the terms. And if you can convince Katina of the merits of joining me, then you can have your happy ending.

....alright.

Ok, the thread is nearing autosage levels, and I'm low on ideas for the next one. I think I'll have a short aside with one of the Shadow Mirrors before we make it to Africa.

Here are your options:

Irm
Ibis
Russel
Latooni
Giado
Lamia
Brooklyn

Choose your destiny.
