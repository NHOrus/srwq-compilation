 For previous threads, see the Team Phantom Tiger website.

 In our last thread, the Neo DC base in Northern Africa was assaulted by the Hagane, commanded by Admiral Sean 'Burn-it-all' Webley, and the Cry Wolves, an elite EFA unit who, according to former leader Kai, should all be dead, but have been converted in biomechanical monstrosities instead. The fighting is intense: The DC forces are quickly turned to rout, the Granzon has overheated after blocking the Tronium Buster Cannon, Irm's Gespenst was trashed fighting the Cerberus, and Van Vat Tran's Rhinoceros landship, carrying Dr. Sophia Nate and the alien Aguija, is charging for the coast at full speed. Things are looking grim for our heroes... Anonymous Sat 20 Feb 2010 18:02:06 No.4561297 Report

 The Black Gespenst flies down straight into a 3-story building, turning the whole thing to rubble as it impacts. Kai lands just a bit away, then stumbles, arc of electricity playing across his hull.

"D-dammit...This things still not properly calibrated...Servos failing all over the place..."

"A good pilot never blames his machine, Kai."

The twisted remnants of Albero Ests mech drag themselves out of the rubble. The thing should not be moving, not with all its limbs crushed and the torso pierced in multiple location, but it still manages a mockery of standing up. Green fluid drips from everywhere, and worm-like ropes wrap around the shattered limbs, creating new, organic ones.

"But then, I may be biased, since I am my mech now."

Kai grimaced, and shakily get his Gespenst to its feet. "So you're just gonna keep coming, then? Keep charging in until everyone is dead, regardles of what state you're in after? Albero was subtler than that."

"Yeah, well, I don't get much choice in my tactics anymore. Frankly, I'm little more than an autopilot for this damned thing, albeit a talkative one. And frankly...part of me likes the pain. It's the only real feeling I get anymore."

The Gespenst Kai falls into a fighting stance. "Oh, boo-hoo, I'm so tragic. I'll shed tears after I stop you from killing everyone in the base."

The black, no, green mechs neck snaps, raises up on an organic neck, and looks around. "What base? You guys are doing more damage to it than us, at this rate."

But Kai is already charging in again.

Well, the correct term is "seething with absorbed energies from one of the most powerful weapons on the planet and in danger of exploding with the force of a nuke if it doesn't carefully shunt the energy into other dimension" but I figured 'overheating' was quicker to type.

 The remnants of the Cry Wolves turn from the wrecked DC mechs to face the oncoming Shadow Mirrors, who strike with fury at the destruction that has been wrought. Arado slams into one with a Sonic Breaker, only for Russel to follow up with a Jet Magnum, causing the thing to explode and the remnants to land among its fellow brethren. Star-1's Armorlion and Jayce's WildRaubtier spin around another, pumping beam shots into it until it falls.

Flying along the ground, the Altarlion pulls the Vegalion to level flight.

"Toby! Daijob...Are you ok?"

"I'm fine, Sets, its just that thing hit my second Tesla Drive, and this things to unstable to fly on one."

"How about if it had three?"

"You're going to try the combination? I'm not sure I can pull it off like this?"

"I beleive in you, Toby. We can do this, together."

"...Right, Sets."

 The Garmraid thrashes out at the Vaisaga, fists, flying mouths, buzzsaws and lasers, all intent on ending the life of Brooklyn Luckfield. The Vaisaga gives ground in large chunks, even as it hacks away at the Super Robots frame.

"Hey, Ms Iiasaki, I could do with a hand!"

The Rathgrith turns away from the shielded Hagane and points its bazooka at the red mech. "Very well."

The F-Solid Shell bursts against the Garmraids leg, shattering the knee buzzsaw and causing it to stumble. With a yell, the Vaisaga flies up and dives down, driving its blade into the Garmraids back, right up to the hilt. The pilot inside howls with rage.

With a surge, the red giant boosts itself into the air and twirls, ripping the blade from the Vaisagas grip. Ignoring the 30 meters of metal stuck inside it, it launches its last Fang Knuckle as the Vaisaga regain control, and the giant jaws clamp around the Vaisaga's arm, and begin to chew.

Then something else grabs the blade. 

"There is nothing I cannot cut!"

The Thrugelmir rips the blade upward, gouging a furrow in the Garmraids chest and almost decapitating it. Then the blade swings around again, into the things side, and a massive chunk of the Garmraid falls away, taking the right arm with it.

 The tentacles wrap around the Cybuster, which attempts to wrench itself free, but the thing with the womans voice is unnaturally strong. And it seems to growing...

"AHOHOHOHOHO!! I'll crush you, eat you, make you my new baby! I'll have a family again!!" The thing laughs as Lat and Ibis pour fire onto it.

"It won't die!!"

"Ibis, use your beam cannon."

"B-but it might hit Masaki!"

"Better damaged than consumed."

"Ugh..."

A flash of white goes past. "I'll handle it!! Divine Blade!!" Ryuune rams her blade into the things back...front...whatever, and the whole assembly screams from more than one mouth.

"NO! I am the Regissuer, the mother of all! I won't fall here."

"Not while I still hold Discutter! Ryuune, get back!!" The Cybuster begins to glow.

Latooni, Ibis and Ryuune boost backwards, firing as they go. More Tentacles wrap around the Cybuster, but thats what he wants.

"CYFLASH!!!"

The wave of energy tears through the tentacles and rips off what little armor the Medius had left. The thing howls in agony and races away. 

"NOOOO! I must grow! Nextlevelnextlevelnextleval I will be All In One!!!"

Then space inverts, and its gone.

 3 beams and a torpedo lance through the red mech, but the after-image just fades away. Admiral Webley curses.

"Where are my area weapons?!? We've trained for this type of assault, how can one mech thats years old defeat this ship!?"

"Sir, I-I-I-" 

"Has the cannon recharged?"

"N-no, the Huckebien took out several capacitors and power feeds, it'll be several minutes more even with the modifications."

"Then prepare an MAPW, and move to bombardment altitude! I will not let them take this ship!!"


Ring curses as the readout on her Black Hole Cannon stays stubbornly in the orange. "Guess the new quantum distortion is too much for the old barrel...better upgrade that." 

The Cry Wolf levels its F2W cannon and roars with a mouth a Gespenst shouldn't have, but Ring swings the EX around in time. One hand busy carrying the cannon, she draws a Roche Saber. 

"I do have to test the suits close-combat abilities too..."

 The Cerberus, reduced to half a torso, a weaponless arm and its legs, continues to flail, but Irm keeps a tight grip as he drags his prisoner towards the Trilobite. 

"NO! KILL ME! KILL MEEE!!!"

"Shut up!! Trilobite 1, take off as soon as I'm aboard, we'll pick up our units as we retreat...huh!!?!?"

With an impressive wheelie, the Raioh rides out of the Trilobite on Dumi, with the Bergelmir floating behind, and boosts skywards.

 Here's what we do.

Kai Gespenst Kick's into the Raioh as the Raioh Rider Kickers into it.

The two units use the force of the attack to rebound off each other, and Kai wipes out Albero with a powered up Gespy Kick.

Meanwhile, Katina does the same to the Hagane's bridge. The force we'd get springboarding off of the Gespenst Kick should make us fast enough to get the drop on the ship.

Think of it thus: Faiz (Katina) and Kaixa (Kai) have just EXCEED CHARGED an Orphenoch at opposite sides. When they kick into the victim, they enter such that Faiz's leg is at just the right angle to springboard off Kaixa's leg mid-kick and proceed to exit upward. The Kaixa kick is driven further into the Albero Orphenoch by Faiz's downward thrust, while Faiz gains the momentum to flip up and pull off another kick against some other kaijin on the adjoining balcony rail.

...I have no clue why Faiz is on my mind this early in the morning. Must be 'cause I just DLed "Eyes Glazing Over."

"Kill everything, gotcha!"

You fly off across the base, and whack a recovering Cry Wolf with Dumis Slash Wheels.

"Kai! Now that we're in combat together, we can do an awesome combo attack together! I was thinking, we jump and kick each other, and bounce off to-"

"Motherfucking piece of shit!!!"

"Eeeehhh..."

The Gespenst Kai is falling apart, one arm is missing, the other clutched around the waist to prevent that joint snapping too. The legs are leaking hydraulic fluid, fast.

The craters left in Albero by the Jet Magnums start to reinflate. "Oh, so now you're so good that any mech you pilot can't take it, is that it, Kai?"

"Grmph...I knew I was rushing the assembly, but I didn't think I'd fucked it up that badly."

Zombie-like, three halfcrushed Cry Wolves pick themselve up off the shattered tarmac. One raises half an F2W cannon at Kai back, as Albero begins to whip him with tentacles.
