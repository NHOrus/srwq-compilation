# Episode 22

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 22: MORTAL KOMBAT 

In our last episode, the Neo DC base in Northern Africa was assaulted by the Hagane, commanded by Admiral Sean 'Burn-it-all' Webley, and the Cry Wolves, an elite EFA unit who, according to former leader Kai, should all be dead, but have been converted in biomechanical monstrosities instead. The fighting is intense: The DC forces are quickly turned to rout, the Granzon has overheated after blocking the Tronium Buster Cannon, Irm's Gespenst was trashed fighting the Cerberus, and Van Vat Tran's Rhinoceros landship, carrying Dr. Sophia Nate and the alien Aguija, is charging for the coast at full speed. Things are looking grim for our heroes... 

---

The Black Gespenst flies down straight into a 3-story building, turning the whole thing to rubble as it impacts. Kai lands just a bit away, then stumbles, arc of electricity playing across his hull.

"D-dammit... This things still not properly calibrated... Servos failing all over the place..."

"A good pilot never blames his machine, Kai."

The twisted remnants of Albero Ests mech drag themselves out of the rubble. The thing should not be moving, not with all its limbs crushed and the torso pierced in multiple location, but it still manages a mockery of standing up. Green fluid drips from everywhere, and worm-like ropes wrap around the shattered limbs, creating new, organic ones.

"But then, I may be biased, since I am my mech now."

Kai grimaced, and shakily get his Gespenst to its feet. "So you're just gonna keep coming, then? Keep charging in until everyone is dead, regardles of what state you're in after? Albero was subtler than that."

"Yeah, well, I don't get much choice in my tactics anymore. Frankly, I'm little more than an autopilot for this damned thing, albeit a talkative one. And frankly... part of me likes the pain. It's the only real feeling I get anymore."

The Gespenst Kai falls into a fighting stance. "Oh, boo-hoo, I'm so tragic. I'll shed tears after I stop you from killing everyone in the base."

The black, no, green mechs neck snaps, raises up on an organic neck, and looks around. "What base? You guys are doing more damage to it than us, at this rate."

But Kai is already charging in again. 

---

The remnants of the Cry Wolves turn from the wrecked DC mechs to face the oncoming Shadow Mirrors, who strike with fury at the destruction that has been wrought. Arado slams into one with a Sonic Breaker, only for Russel to follow up with a Jet Magnum, causing the thing to explode and the remnants to land among its fellow brethren. Star-1's Armorlion and Jayce's WildRaubtier spin around another, pumping beam shots into it until it falls.

Flying along the ground, the Altarlion pulls the Vegalion to level flight.

"Toby! Daijob... Are you ok?"

"I'm fine, Sets, its just that thing hit my second Tesla Drive, and this things to unstable to fly on one."

"How about if it had three?"

"You're going to try the combination? I'm not sure I can pull it off like this?"

"I beleive in you, Toby. We can do this, together."

"...Right, Sets." 

---

The Garmraid thrashes out at the Vaisaga, fists, flying mouths, buzzsaws and lasers, all intent on ending the life of Brooklyn Luckfield. The Vaisaga gives ground in large chunks, even as it hacks away at the Super Robots frame.

"Hey, Ms Iiasaki, I could do with a hand!"

The Rathgrith turns away from the shielded Hagane and points its bazooka at the red mech. "Very well."

The F-Solid Shell bursts against the Garmraids leg, shattering the knee buzzsaw and causing it to stumble. With a yell, the Vaisaga flies up and dives down, driving its blade into the Garmraids back, right up to the hilt. The pilot inside howls with rage.

With a surge, the red giant boosts itself into the air and twirls, ripping the blade from the Vaisagas grip. Ignoring the 30 meters of metal stuck inside it, it launches its last Fang Knuckle as the Vaisaga regain control, and the giant jaws clamp around the Vaisaga's arm, and begin to chew.

Then something else grabs the blade. 

"There is nothing I cannot cut!"

The Thrugelmir rips the blade upward, gouging a furrow in the Garmraids chest and almost decapitating it. Then the blade swings around again, into the things side, and a massive chunk of the Garmraid falls away, taking the right arm with it. 

---

The tentacles wrap around the Cybuster, which attempts to wrench itself free, but the thing with the womans voice is unnaturally strong. And it seems to growing...

"AHOHOHOHOHO!! I'll crush you, eat you, make you my new baby! I'll have a family again!!" The thing laughs as Lat and Ibis pour fire onto it.

"It won't die!!"

"Ibis, use your beam cannon."

"B-but it might hit Masaki!"

"Better damaged than consumed."

"Ugh..."

A flash of white goes past. "I'll handle it!! Divine Blade!!" Ryuune rams her blade into the things back... front... whatever, and the whole assembly screams from more than one mouth.

"NO! I am the Regissuer, the mother of all! I won't fall here."

"Not while I still hold Discutter! Ryuune, get back!!" The Cybuster begins to glow.

Latooni, Ibis and Ryuune boost backwards, firing as they go. More Tentacles wrap around the Cybuster, but thats what he wants.

"CYFLASH!!!"

The wave of energy tears through the tentacles and rips off what little armor the Medius had left. The thing howls in agony and races away. 

"NOOOO! I must grow! Nextlevelnextlevelnextlevel I will be All In One!!!"

Then space inverts, and its gone. 

---

3 beams and a torpedo lance through the red mech, but the after-image just fades away. Admiral Webley curses.

"Where are my area weapons?!? We've trained for this type of assault, how can one mech thats years old defeat this ship!?"

"Sir, I-I-I-" 

"Has the cannon recharged?"

"N-no, the Huckebien took out several capacitors and power feeds, it'll be several minutes more even with the modifications."

"Then prepare an MAPW, and move to bombardment altitude! I will not let them take this ship!!"

Ring curses as the readout on her Black Hole Cannon stays stubbornly in the orange. "Guess the new quantum distortion is too much for the old barrel... better upgrade that." 

The Cry Wolf levels its F2W cannon and roars with a mouth a Gespenst shouldn't have, but Ring swings the EX around in time. One hand busy carrying the cannon, she draws a Roche Saber. 

"I do have to test the suits close-combat abilities too..." 

---

The Cerberus, reduced to half a torso, a weaponless arm and its legs, continues to flail, but Irm keeps a tight grip as he drags his prisoner towards the Trilobite. 

"NO! KILL ME! KILL MEEE!!!"

"Shut up!! Trilobite 1, take off as soon as I'm aboard, we'll pick up our units as we retreat... huh!!?!?"

With an impressive wheelie, the Raioh rides out of the Trilobite on Dumi, with the Bergelmir floating behind, and boosts skywards.

"K-Katina? How... The Raioh was in pieces!!"

"Never underestimate the power of Science!!! Now, who do you need beaten??"

Irm blinks. "Well, since we're out to evac, you can try covering us, maybe interfere with the Hag-"

"Kill everything, gotcha!"

You fly off across the base, and whack a recovering Cry Wolf with Dumis Slash Wheels.

"Kai! Now that we're in combat together, we can do an awesome combo attack together! I was thinking, we jump and kick each other, and bounce off to-"

"Motherfucking piece of shit!!!"

"Eeeehhh..."

The Gespenst Kai is falling apart, one arm is missing, the other clutched around the waist to prevent that joint snapping too. The legs are leaking hydraulic fluid, fast.

The craters left in Albero by the Jet Magnums start to reinflate. "Oh, so now you're so good that any mech you pilot can't take it, is that it, Kai?"

"Grmph... I knew I was rushing the assembly, but I didn't think I'd fucked it up that badly."

Zombie-like, three halfcrushed Cry Wolves pick themselve up off the shattered tarmac. One raises half an F2W cannon at Kai back, as Albero begins to whip him with tentacles.

"Not today, buster!" A familiar lick of plasma plays around the Raiohs leg as it dives at Albero. He jumps away from a direct hit, but is still scorched. 

"When we met last time, I just had a glorified Aeroplane, now you face the real Katina Tarask!"

The black-green thing sprouts gunbarrels and begins launching energy beams and spikes of bone at you, but you ignore them and roundhouse it to the face. Kai falls back as the team round on the remaining Cry Wolves. Fire of all sorts streams at the pseuodomechs, blasting the few remaining apart.

The DGG-04 Motorad flies up, past the Huckebien stabbing at a Cry-Wolf, and sights the Hagane, engaged in a sniping duel with Lamia. The pink mech desperately manuvers, after-images winking in and out of existence frantically, as it launches arrows at the battleship. The barriers around the vessel grow weak from the power drain, slivers of energy start to get through.

*Dumi to all Shadow Mirrors, I'm detecting MAPWs being deployed from the Hagane. Launch in 1 minute, Only a 53% chance of intercept. I recommend retreat.*

---

Albero and the 4 standing Cry Wolves retreat to a crater in the middle of the the base and warp out, just as you bombard the crater with your Harken Impulse weapons. Swearing, you look around to see the wrecks of the other wolves igniting, burning up with some kind of white energy, leaving nothing behind.

The Trilobites lift off, as the team heads back to them. The only people still fighting are Wodan and Brooklyn, dragging the wrecked Garmraid to the ground as it continues to flail.

"Dammit people, hurry up!!" Screams Irm. "We've got to get out of here!"

*That's not a guarantee of escape, commander. They also have the Tronium weapon, its damaged but could still fire if we leave them alone. The Trilobites would be a likely target.*

"Shit... What can we do?"

*30 seconds to launch. Preparing intercept protocols.*

---

 "Wait, where's that sciency dude?"

"You called for me, Ms Tarask?" The Granzon floats into the air, a little worse for wear but functional.

"Can't you redirect the missile with your teleport?"

"Madame, the Granzon has only just recovered from redirecting one such energy release, do you really think another will be as easy?"

"Not the explosion, the missile!!!"

Shuu blinks. "I'm not sure... I fully follow you."

*I do. Allow me to access the Granzons targeting controls, Dr. Shirakawa, and I'll see what I can do...*

---

"Admiral, they're falling back!!"

"Too late, rats! Launch the MAPW!!!"

"Sir! Launching, ten seconds to impact! 8, 7, 6...It's gone sir!!"

"What?!!? How did they shoot it down at this range?"

"No wait, it's reappeared... Above us!!"

"No!! Overboost!! Overbo-"

The morning sky over northern Africa suddenly gains a new sun, as 47 kilotons of Duodec explosive ignite against the Haganes shields, covering the entire vessel in a fireball a mile wide. 

---

"This....is intolerable."

"Indeed. An entire squad of our ascended defeated, the second such group this week, and forced to retreat to the Home Space, no less."

"How can such a thing come to pass? Our enemies should have no weapons of this magnitude!"

"How naive... if there were no groups capable of threatening us, we wouldn't even have to keep up this charade of humanity."

"Stop bickering! The problem will not be solved like that. We must have action!"

"But where shall we get the forces? Project Zeitgiest is still incomplete, and it may take days to generate more ascended."

"...It may be that we'll have to risk THEM."

"No! SHE would only find a way to turn them on us!"

"You think SHE hasn't begun such a plan already? Again you show exteme naivety!"

"Enough! Prepare observers, and send them to Izu. Fabricate the needed evidence based on the Zezernan Files. Turn these 'Irregulars' into aliens in the eyes of as many as possible, then SHE will be forced to either destroy them for us, or act against us directly." 

---

"And now that you're done showing off, what about our real problem?"

*I assume you mean your promises to Vat Tran.*

"You've made me promise him quite a few things that I can't deliver, even with Magus at my disposal."

*Unfortunate, but hardly insurmountable. I doubt we'll be doing much more than stringing him along for a while.*

"Yes, you have your 'real' plan, which you're awfully quiet about."

*If I told you, you wouldn't beleive me. And I know that's saying something, seeing as you're a corpse thats been revived with technology that doesn't actually exist.*

"So, you just want me to keep distracting Vat Tran, then?"

*That, and talk to the alien. She could be crucial, if we can get her on our side. She might be able to point them there.*

"Where, exactly?"

*Space, my dear Sophia. Get them into space, and I can handle the rest.*

Johnathan Kazahara looks at the pile of scrap that fills the hangar of the Trilobite. "Damn... better take stock..."

---

The crew of the Taussendfuessler start in shock at the cockpit of the enemy super is opened. Ring turns away, looking ill. Masaki looks like he actually will get ill. Ryuune grits her teeth in anger. The young teenaged Cynthia starts to cry. Even Wodan grits his teeth at what he sees.

Jayce looks disgusted. "We've gotta cut him out of there... we can cut him out of there, right?"

Shuu looks impassively at the young red-haired man, and the organic outgrowths that have been crudely grafted to his body. "So this is the face of my enemy... to them, the human body is but a plaything. My knowledge of medicine is not perfect, Mr. Starlord, but I do believe extracting these people from the organic apparatus is our first priority. If nothing else, we have to ascertain if they're still human..." 

---

A segment of the Trilobites medical bay is warded off, and the captives transferred in. Shine shudders as they pass her bed.

"They... they have grim futures..."

Irm grimaces. "Well, at least they'll have futures. Shuu says he can fix them... most of the way."

"Might not be worth it."

"Not your judgement call to make, girl. Now, maybe I should return to your questioning, we've learnt a few things since the last one."

"I severely doubt that, given that you still employ that psycho in the dress."

"We've confirmed from dismantling your R-Blade that you're with Project SRX, and we know about the clandestine war between them and the Council."

"....And?"

"Well... maybe you'd like to tell us a little bit more about that?"

"Who do you think you are, you anarchist? I'm Princess Shine Hausen, monarch of Riksent-in-exile, and Major in the EFA army. You and your thugs are nothing but a bunch of terrorist, starting wars for your own amusement and-"

"Oh god, will someone give that baby a pacifier?!?"

Irm swings around to the other bed in the room. "Axel??!"

"...Where's my jacket?"

"Don't think I can't hear you, even out here." You kick in the door and start yelling at Shine. "I thought I taught you to shut your mouth about your so-called credentials, when you're barely out of daipers... Oh, hey Axel. Looking kinda studly there."

Down to his boxers, Axel casts about the room for his clothes. "Did the orderlies toss them out, or something?"

"Uh, Lamia took them."

"Who?"

"Lamia Loveless, the Angelg pilot."

"The Doll? What they hell would she want with them."

You shrug. 

"Well, anyway, I'll scrounge up from supplies. Now, could someone explain to me exactly what happened.

Irm is about to speak up when you jump in front of him and begin your tirade.

HOMEWORK FOR THE LOT OF YOU: SUMMARIZE EVERYTHING THATS HAPPENED TO AXEL. You can do the whole story of everything thats happened to your group, or just cover what happened since Axel was KOed. Remember, this is from Katinas distinctly non-omniscient POV. Best entry goes into the next post.

"Ok, so, apparently we picked you up after you had a bad fight with some kick-ass real type. I was too busy checking out Mardi Gras, but Dumi told me what happened. ANYWAY we brought you and Bullet and Ensign Mickey back to the South America base while Irm, Kai, and Lat tried to figure out what to do. I led most of the rest of the team on a team building exercise! Yeah. But you were passed out, Lamia took your clothes to become a real person, and then Princess Prissy over there showed up and we had to bail.

We decided to bail cause the EFA would probably show up and hook up with some more DC guys. Oh, we had met with Ryuune Zoldark a while back and agreed to do something for her in exchange for gas. I forget what. So we saved Vat Tran's ass from some trio of battleships, hooked up with them, saved the remains of the Earth Cradle, then had an epic battle with the Hagane. Also we found out the EFA is basically split into two factions, one of which is made of evil alien tentacle monsters. We also picked up Echidna and her W-guys somewhere along the way, I was too busy kicking things to death to remember specifically."

I know I got some things out of order, but what the heck.

Uh...shit. I can't even remember when Axel even joined up, let alone when he was KO'd and Soulgain trashed. ANYWAY, ATTEMPT BEGINS.

"Well, see your new roommate here? We caught her spyin' on us after we flew on down to South America for repairs and supplies from the underground cells. Picked up a couple of the Irregulars along the way, but no worries. They seem pretty cool so far. Anyway, the big news? Turns out she's from that super hot-shit brigade out east, the...S-E-X Force or some shit. Says she's got some kinda super mind-powers, sees the future or somethin', won't shut up about that crap."

"Anyway, after that we hooked up with that old guy and his fleet and went off to the Cradle to pick up some stuff. Turns out the head lady there was workin' on some new tech that makes robots heal or somethin', like your Soulgain, 'cept it don't eat at ya. It's really cool, we stuck some on Raioh and it fixed itself all nice and pretty-like. But the EFA, see, they want this stuff, so they sent down the Cry Wolves, who’re dead, 'cept they're not and now they're tentacle beasties, and they kicked all our asses. We got saved by this Wodan guy and his super-Grungast and his pretty friend in her weird bug-Hucky-thing, and they all came back with us along with Sophia, the doc lady.”

“Then we came back, and we forced Kai to tell us why we were fighting zombies in Africa. He says that the EFA is being run by space monsters now, and Princess Future-Britches here was from the group fightin’ them. ‘Cept they’re not good either and we don’t know what they want ‘cause she won’t shut up about how special she is.” *Insert menacing glare when appropriate.* “Anyway, they sent their big ship with their fancy moustache captain and more of the same tentacle zombie Gespies after us just now, along with a bunch of weird fancy prototype mechs. We beat them before they blew us all up and captured a couple. You wanna see an alien, Axel?”

 Axel pulls on his appropriated uniform. "So you're actually listening to the Irregulars horseshit?"

Irm folds his arms. "They're good people, Axel, they're just desperate. If our world was at risk like that, we'd be doing much the same."

"Our world is at risk, BECAUSE of them. Idiots with good intentions are still idiots, Irm."

"....Also, we needed the firepower."

"Now that's a proper reason." Axel pulls on boots. "As for this two sides thing...I think Vindel and Lemon knew something about it, but weren't sure. Any luck finding them, by the by?"

"Nothing yet, but Vat Trans alien buddy says she can make a gizmo to scan for the Zweizergain. We...were planning to find out where Vindel was, then send the Irregulars somewhere else."

"Sounds like a good plan. Maybe you're cut out for command after all, Irm."

"...It was Kai's plan, actually."

"Oh...there's a can of worms."

 You find Kai at the hangar, sitting on the unattached arm of his Gespenst, working a ratchet on a servo. He doesn't seem to be that into it.

"Kai? Axel's awake, he'd like to talk to you."

Kai turns around and flops down onto the Gespensts hand. "Hello, Major. Finally come to execute me?"

"Naw, I just wanted to see the only other man the EFA considered as big a deal as Beowulf."

"I think its safe to say the Beowulfs not a man, at this point."

Axel looks oddly at Kai. "So...I take it you've run into him and his green-blooded cronies?"

"...Yeah, something like that."

"You know, I'm not getting the vibe I was expecting from an Ex-Agressor."

"Agressors are old news these days, Major Almer. It's all about technology now, not pilots. Mass-production, machine cells, organic mechs, the pilots....are just parts now."

"And you're going to accept that, old man?"

A light reappears in Kais good eye. "No. No I amn't. Major Almer, I need to start a war. Can you help me?"

"I might just be able to oblige you."

 The transfer to Trilobite 2 goes smoothly, and you're soon in the other hangar. Ibis waves at you, and Irm quickly hides behind the Vegalion.

The Soulgain is as you saw it then it teleported into Brazil, gouges everywhere and green orbs popped like zits. If it's been regenerating on its own.

Axel grunts. "Dammit...I knew Beowulf had hit something important, but I didn't think it'd fuck up the self-repair this badly."

"Can you do something about it?"

"I'm not sure..." Axel puts a hand on the Soulgains fuselage. As he does so the metal starts to glow, and the nearby scratches start to fill in....

And then Axel collapses.

"Boss-man!! You ok?"

Axel picks himself up. "Ugh...its no good. The Lifeforce Absorber is out of whack, I so much as sit in the cockpit, its liable to kill me. My own mech...Shit!!"

"Can't...can't someone fix it? Maybe Johnathan can-"

"Johnny's an old hand, meant to building classic, reliable mechs. The Earthgain series is way over his head, heck, very few of TLIs people even half know how they're making them. No, there's a very short list of people who can fix the Soulgain...Lemon, and the guy who gave us the Lifeforce technology in the first place."

Irm raises an eyebrow. "Dr. Albark? He walked out of the TLI a year ago, on some kinda vision quest thing. No-ones seen him since."

"Yeah...well, those people won't be trying as hard as me."

Only one thing to do... Have Axel pilot one of the mechs we captured instead, I mean, He is good pilot and shouldn´t really need his SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE mech to be efficent. And we need all people we can get.

We didn't capture anything intact, is the problem. Just pieces of the Cerebus and the cockpit block of the Garmraid. We're currently a little poor on the mecha budget right now.

Oh, while we're on the Twolibite we should see about checking out those DC pilots. Give them props and introduce ourselves.

 The Vegalion and Altairlion fly out of the hangar and off to the Rhino, finally allowing the room for the R-Blade to be brought out of maintenance. Brooklyn looks her over, seeming to be relatively satisfied. "It's got good poise, and looks pretty light on its toes. It should suffice, Major."

"Don't worry, I'll have the Vaisaga back to you once I've found what I need. Now, what exactly are the DC doing?"

"Vat Tran said his ships were headed for a more secure location in the Congo, but whether we can make it there undetected is another thing. The Trilobites and the Killer Whale with the DCs gear should be safe, but the Rhino kinda stick out, especially the Golden one."

Axel ponders. "We won't get that alien scanner until we're in a secure location...maybe we should run interference."

"What, like....attack the EFA?? In our condition?"

"If it gets all the Inspector tech to the right place, it may be worth the risk."

WHAT WILL KATINA SAY TO THIS SUGGESTION? OR DOES SHE HAVE HER OWN POINTS TO BRING UP?

Because I'm an idiot, I forgot to insert that Axel turns to Irm for all this info. Brooklyn's not dumb or anything, but he hasn't been talking to Vat Tran.

I think attacking the EFA so soon is kinda dumb, We should first repair all our stuff and check things out with our prisoners, We might obtain a more efficient option that way. Who knows, Besides those Einst thingies might have telepathy-GPS-Hivemind senses and sense our prisoners when we approach the EFA base, Meaning we wouldn´t be able to senak attack them.

This, suggest that since those thinks have been able to track us for so long with such high accuracy, they must have some sort of alien-psychic-radar ability and because of that we might became from hunters to hunted.

 "I dunno, I think we should see about these prisoners of our first. I mean, if they are part of the alien hive mind, maybe their psychic resonances are leading enemy forces to us right now!"

Axel blinks, then sighs. "Irm, check who's able to fight and prep a strike team. I'll go see if theres anything we can tell from these prisoners."


Shuu looms over the disecting table, prodding at one of the alien pseudopod with all manner of arcane instruments.

"So...Doc...what can you tell us about the things from beyond Saturn?"

"Carbon-based life, genetic code reminiscent of DNA. Slight dimensional vibration implies their origin is from another universe, rather than outer space. The organic components are connected only to the pilot, not to any of the mechanical systems, implying they don't have compatability, at least with the mech we captured."

"What, so these mechs weren't like the tentacle things the Cry Wolves were using?"

"In this case, at least, it seems the alien technology was being used as a mind control system, sending some form of mental radiation to and from a local location. It seems likely there was a control system nearby, either on the Hagane or one of the mechs."

"Would it still work, if they showed up again?"

"Unlikely, the actual body modification on these two was minimal...after the surgery, at least. And the organic components are dying now, so they don't seem to be remote organisms, merely parasites to the pilots."

"So, those two are fine now?"

Shuu blinks. "I wouldn't say...fine...The girl is in mental shock, and the man...well, he doesn't have limbs. The alien appeared to have grafted their technology directly onto severed stumps."

Axel barely blinks. "Sounds like business as usual down in EFA central."

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUCK.

Seems the MX guys won't enter into battle for some time.....and that's a massive understatement.

 Well the MX duo have certainly seen better days. Aqua might be back in action sooner than Hugo after some bonding time with Katina though.

When you say "back into action" you mean as a sex slave? And bonding as "lesbian sex" right?

That wasn't quite what I was getting at but that works too. Preferably after actual bonding and helping Aqua get better mentally.

Sounds like Kai knew her better, I'd rather leave him to do it while we focus on the people we've already become friends with. I've always thought we've been spreading our attention too thin.

 "Irm, what do we have?"

Irm pulls out a notebook. "The Raioh and Dumi are good to go, thanks to those Machine Cells. Same with the StealthRaubtier, we'll just have to put me or Russel in it, or switch around pilots. The Angelg is good-"

"Still need to talk to her about my clothes..."

"Er...You can take the Vaisaga, the Guarlion will be fixed within the hour, and the Huckebien should be good to go by then as well. Plus we have the Valsione and Cybuster, but I think you want to keep the Irregulars out of this, don't you?"

"Just a bit...But that sounds like we could have a strike team."

"Yeah, Axel, but where?"

"Where what?"

"Where would we be sending this team? All the way back to Dakar? They'd be stranded unless a Trilobite went with them. There are no major EFA bases until you get to Capetown, which is the same distance. I can maybe understand your point of distracting the EFA, but theres no easily available target."

Well, since we're being ambitious, might I suggest something?

 "Why is this mech talking to me?"

"Its Dumi, the DGG-04's AI. He's quite the help."

"I thought Lemon said it wasn't going to be finished for months..."

*May I continue?*

"Sure, I guess..."

*The EFAs major tactical advantage is its supremacy in space, and its total control over the satellite network. With these eyes in the sky, they can track virtually anything on the planet, so long as they have enough into to find it. The Shadow Mirrors can evade their detection with the Stealth Shades on the Trilobites, but the issue is with our allies. The Rhinoceros class ships were build with the intent of open warfare, not clandestine operations, thus don't have such adapations.*

"Yeah, we covered all that..."

*To avoid detection we need to break the EFAs tracking long enough for the Rhinos location to change, that they cannot find them instantly once tracking resumes. A distraction would be one option, but to divert the attentions of all the EFA satellites it would have to be a large-scale assault, against a major facility. And as Irm pointed out, there are no such bases on the continent.*

"So that leaves us back where we started? Man, this is a dumb computer."

*There is no target on the continent, but there is a target within 1000 kilometers.*

"What target?"

*One of the satellites themselves. *
