# Episode 44

##SRWQ Mission 44: Just one more thing...

In our last episode, Interdimensional Runaway Duminass 7 finally came up with a plan to strike back at his evil master, Dark Brain, by recreating the scattered shards of previously destroyed universe into a new world, where Dark Brains enemy Warrior Roar and the Compatible Kaiser, as well as Dumi himself and his Homonculi, would forever be safe from the interdimensional tyrants grasp. However, this new plan presents a terrible dilemma for our heroine, Katina Tarask: If she and her team of ex-School refugees and former Shadow Mirrors joins Dumi in this new world, they may never be able to leave...

Desperate for a way around this, Katina turns to the Irregulars who started this whole mess, asking for the use of their technology, but they seem reluctant, afraid that dimensional travel will cause more harm than good. As Katina talks with them, she learns that one Excellen Browning has divined the secret of one of her enemies, the Council of the First and Only: That they intend not only to pacify her world, but to use Humanity as the basis for a new combined race...

---

You boot in the door of Tetsuya Onoderas office, almost taking it off the hinges. Which is particularly impressive since its a sliding door. The young captain almost jumps out of his seat.

"YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS!" You point an accusatory finger. "You knew the EFA are aliens going to use us as fucktoys and breed their new master race! And you were going to FUCKING ABANDON US!! You self-righteous cockbags!!!"

*Katina, insulting the man won't help.*

"It's the only thing stopping me from wringing his scrawny neck!! So I'd say its helping!!"

Tetsuya raises his hands. "P-Please, Ka... Ms Tarask, we-we... We were as shocked by what Excellen learned as you were. We're still digesting the information. It's only been a few days, we haven't really had a chance to digest it al-"

"And you never would have, because you were going to run out on us, you prick!"

*Katina, please, try to be rational for once!*

"Fuck you, Dumi! These people are willing to let you MELT YOUR FUCKING BRAIN to save their stupid world, but they won't lift a finger to save us! How the fuck is that fair?"

Tetsuya gulps. "Its not like that, Ms Tarask, really, we just haven't worked it all out y-"

"Where you or where you not planning to bug out and go back to your world? Answer me straight, or I'll feed your schlong to Masakis talking cats!!"

"We don't have a plan! Or at least, we didn't have one that survived contact with the enemy, so to speak. Look, please, just sit down, and I'll explain! Seriously!"

"...I'll stand, but go on."

"When the Cracks started appearing in our world, we really didn't know what to do. We could tell it was some kind of dimensional effect, and that there were space-time distortions similar to the summoning of Dark Brain, so we knew who was responsible, but that was it. There wasn't a whole lot we could do with the technology at hand. Then, out of nowhere, the XN Giest appeared in low earth orbit, and Lefina managed to recover it before it burned up. She took it to Gilliam. He was reluctant, but he found out what has happening and how. Originally, he was going to take it alone to your world, and... well, I'm not sure he was planning to come back. But Ratsel and Sanger convinced him, and the rest of us agreed, that after what happened with Ring, we had to do it properly."

"So you all jumped to our world to attack us and take the Zweizergain."

"Not exactly... Things went wrong quickly. We originally had planned to arrive well before when we did, possibly even to Gilliams own past as Helios Olympos, and convince him to stop the creation of the Lygeios and Acquies before it became an issue. Then we would deal with Duminass, and return. But, once we approached your world, we crossed too close to the time-stream we were trying to stop. The Zweizergains signal drew us in and we hit the Shadow Mirror fleet head-on. We would have been lost in the void if Gilliam hadn't forced us to materialise then and there."

"After that, we tried to salvage the plan by talking to your EFA for assistance finding the Zweizergain. We'd expected them to be hard to deal with, based on what Lamia knew, but literally five minutes after our first transmission, they started using their jamming satellites and assembling their fleet for attack. We had no idea they'd be this hostile. We soon found ourselves with no allies bar Ryuune and maybe your ship, and half the planet was out to kill us for no reason we could determine. We're not unused to tough times, but this, this was a bit much..."

"I'm been like that for months and you don't see me bitching about it!"

"Yeah, well... I'm trying to explain how off the Plan things had gotten. Even with Gilliam, who knew this universe, we weren't getting anywhere. Literally the only things going right for us were what you were finding. So when we discovered about the First and Only... We didn't think we could do anything about it without screwing everything up even worse."

"And that's your excuse? Being afraid of things going wrong?"

"Well given our track record so far! Katina, we're responsible for the deaths of HUNDREDS, Shadow Mirrors and EFA pilots that have basically impaled themselves on our weapons because of a glitch in our travel data! That... that doesn't sit easy with us. We've managed, in one week, to set in motion the collapse of the entire resistance movement of your world, and put your EFA on the brink of a civil war! Thousands could die because of this! We're... afraid, that if we keep this up, we'll just make things worse."

"...But you saved us all."

Tetsuya is unprepared for the sudden moe-face. "Uh, whu?"

"I heard from Dumi that our universe would have been destroyed by the Shards just the same as yours. Your coming here and changing time, it saved us from Dark Brain too. And you got the First and Only to show their true colors. Now everyone is working against them, and people are spreading the world about them... The civil war you've set in motion, I hate to sound like Vindel, but it could be what this world needs."

Tetsuya looks stunned. "Er, well, I hadn't thought of it that way..."

"Mr Andale... We're not mad at you. Well, I'm not anyway. I... I understand what its like to have everything you plan turn to ash in your hands, I know how heart-breaking it can be. But, you don't have to worry about this. This thing you've started, we can turn it around. You can go home with a clear conscience, and we can solve the problems of this world. We just need this one thing from you..."

"Th... The Zweizergain, right?"

"Please, Mr Overday, this one thing is the one missing piece of the puzzle. Once we can get from the New World to this one, we can finally have a safe place to regroup, to get ourselves sorted out, and to turn this whole mess around. If you can just convince Gilliam of that, we'll be able to save the world... not as well as you did, but enough to matter."

"Erm... Well... I'll have to-"

Loud blaring sirens go off as Tetsuyas comm panel lights up.

"MOTHERFUCKING ALARMS!! WHY ALWAYS AT THE IMPORTANT MOMENTS!??!"

Dumi helpfully tunes your earpiece into the Kuroganes bridge as you run to the Hangar to pick up your R-Blade.

"Eita, report!"

"Sir!! The Hiryu is sending a distress signal! The city of Izhevsk is under attack!"

"By who?"

"The enemy teleported in with a distinct space-time signature... It appears to be the Aerogaters, sir!"

"What?? But thats... They're not supposed to be in this dimension, are they?"

The voices fade out as you reach the Hangar, and Dumi's voice reasserts itself. *Ah yes... We never did tell them about the Balmarians in much detail, did we? Probably to prevent them overreacting like this. It seems they've met the Neviim forces before.*

"But what the hell are they doing attacking a random city? Why would they do anything to the Earth? They said they were going to work with us to make the Earth friendly to Aliens, how does this help them?"

*I don't think we have the full picture here, Katina. We won't know until we get there, I suspect.*

---

Ryusei blinks at the cloud of enemies surrounding the city. "They look like Bugs, but they're more... fish-shaped."

Viletta floats up beside the R-series mechs, the Boxer Frame flexing its massive fists. "They certainly look like Aerogater technology... And they're using the same MO, they appear to be capturing people. We don't have time to waste, let's move people!!"

The SRX team blast off into the fight, with the Angelg flying after. Kai warms up his Tesla Drive and eases his Gespenst up into the air. "We're gonna be late for the fight, people! Get the lead out!"

Russel eases his Gespenst off the launch platform, and turns to the red mech behind him. "Lieutenant, its not like you to be last to launch..."

Katina gives her partner a dirty look over the comm window. "Don't give me lip, Russel! Now, I spy a set of artillery units on the north side. While the rest are cleaning up the guppies, lets us two find out if these Gespensts Customs are really worth a damned."

"Lt., I don't think we're meant to split away from the others..."

"You're not being paid to think, Russel! Now either get moving or get out of my way!"

---

You wait patiently as the Irregulars arrange themselves on the Kuroganes catapults and launch platforms first, leaving you as part of the second wave. "Dumi, link the comm to Bet Barshem, as secure as you can make it. We need to hear her side to this."

*I've already talked to her. She claims she knows nothing of this, and is talking to her superiors to try to get clarification. Her vital signs indicate she's being truthful, but its possible she's been kept in the dark on this.*

"Yeah, maybe... But I still don't see what the Balmarians would gain from just attacking a place like this."

*I can't think of much either, expect perhaps... people.*

"What, you mean like they did with Tytti and Kar-Wai? Brainwash them into their soldiers? Why would they do that now?"

They lack military strength, remember, and they're likely low on engineers as well. Izhevsk is part of the Ural Mining Belt, its got a well-educated workforce and is pretty distant from any EFA bases. If the Balmarians want to rebuild their infrastructure, and have decided they don't want to wait for help from Earth, its as good a place as any to start.

"...Do you really think thats it? That their promises were bullshit, and they planned to just take what they needed from Earth all along?"

As I said, its too early to call right now. But given the risk of angering the EFA and provoking either faction to attack them, I'd say if it is what it looks like, then the Balmarians have either made a critical error, or we've majorly underestimated them.

You're considering cutting your way out of the Kuroganes hull when the Grungust finally launches off the top platform, and you can finally get out of the Kurogane. Outside, you see the Irregulars are well ahead, with your allies bringing up the rear as Dumi transports them to the front.

Intruiging...A line of PT-type units blocking the southern approaches, and units on the northern ridges providing long-ranger anti-air fire, which the fish-like units in the centre of the city go about the gruesome work of kidnapping the populace. Over a hundred units total, this won't end well...

"Can you identify the units properly yet, Dumi?"

Not to my satisfaction...I think we should get closer, Katina. And save some lives while we're at it.

JOIN IRREGULARS IN BATTLE, TRY TO GET AROUND TO THE ARTILLERY, OR SAVE THE PEOPLE? You have Wodan, Tis, Lalia, Despinis, Dumi, and your R-Blade. The Eurydice and the Illusion are hanging back, as they're quite vunerable compared to the likes of the Kurogane.

Time to split up. The vast majority of our units are boss-caliber at least, so at the very least half of them can support the Irregulars in battle, or draw aggro from the fish and keep them from abducting people. Katina can sneak up on the arty and disrupt them at beating range, where there guns should be ineffective.

Keep Dumi or Wodan on speed-dial, or just bring one of them with us for extra help blowing up alien support guns, especially if they're all Ezekiels. Pray for Habbakuks.

Wodan would be able to shrug off the hits from the art better due to his better armor, and Kat's R-Blade would work better for the rescues due to it's better speed.

"I am the Sword of Magus, I don't take orders from the likes of you."

"Sophia will cry if you don't!"

Wodan doesn't answer that, but he does fly after you as you boost towards the city. The R-Blade has been finely tuned by the Shadow Mirror engineers, and its has a properly fitted Tesla Drive at last. You feel even more confident in this one than the last, and that mech made you feel like a tornado made of swords.

(Today is St Patricks Day and I'm Irish. Don't expect too many updates.)

The ring-lasers flash about you as you flip and twist towards the enemy, but with most of them occupied with thier kidnappings theres not a whole lot of them to guard the others. You managed to find a gap in their firing line, boost around a comm tower and impale one on your right tonfa.

"Dumi, catch!!" You toss the tiny thing through the air, and, in a quite disturbing fashion, Dumi's brain-body opens up and engulfs it, like a squid catching its dinner. You turn back to the things fellows, which look intent on your murder.

"Tell me once you know where they store the prisoners!!" You leap into the fray, blades flashing, as you chop down the undersized mobile weapons. Wodan floats stationary, soaking up dozens of shots as his eye beams casually pick off Fish after Fish. He seems utterly unconcerned by the small amount of damage he's recieving.

Suddenly, much larger beams start streaking across the battlefield. Several tall buildings lose their top floors as you begin to evade the plasma beams, while craters begin to erupt in the Thrudgelmirs armor. It seems the Artillery mechs are starting up in earnest now.

I'll need another minute or two, Katina. Oh, and you should all know, theres another incoming warp signature, and its pretty big.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

"G-Godammit, wheres the Raioh when you need it?" You drop altitude quickly, slicing up more Fish as you fall, taking cover behind buildings.

Hrrmmm...more bad news. If you see any Fish with rings held in their mouths, those ones have captured humans in their pattern buffers. I...I don't think we have the technology to reconstitute them we'd need Balmar tech to do that.

"Shit! So we gotta stop them before they get their victims!" You pounce on a Fish which is sniffing through a car-park, and cut it into three pieces. You switch to infrared to find the signatures of people: Where they go, the Fish will likely follow.

The Beams flash through the superstructure of the carpark and blossom into grey clouds either side of you. Atomised concrete is everywhere as the bombardment heats up.

"What the hell?!?! They're destroying the city! What is this shit?!"

They suddenly seem more intent on getting you and Wodan than on their originaKATINA, BEHIND YOU!!!

You flip around, except an oncoming wave of mechs, but instead see only some form of skyscraper, which has had the base of it blasted off, and it currently falling over, onto your R-Blade...

"Goddamn piece of shit!" Katina isn't helping Russel move her mech, being too preoccupied with reloading her shotgun. "They upgrade the entire fucking vernier array and it still takes two fucking seconds for a full thrust reversal? Why did Gill and Kai bother with this retarded waste of a mech? And that transforming cannon, way too big..."

"Lt., maybe we should worry about reaching cover rather than drafting a test report on the mechs."

"Russel, I don't tell you how to be a support wingman, you don't tell me how to be a test pilot!! Now where's the closest of those bastards, I wanna try out the new slug round for the shIIIITTT!"

The new mech begins to unload into the hillside behind the gulley, Beam Rifle in one hand, combi-gatling-and-missile launcher in the other, a shoulder cannon pumping out AP rounds. Katinas targeting sensors show lights winking out as the heavily armored alien guns start to disintegrate under the barrage.

"Whoooo! Been way too long since I put Minerva through her paces!"

"You! Who are you, and what are you doing here?"

"You can call us the the Snipers, honey, and we're here to save the day! Now sit back and watch the masters at work!" The black mechs arms fly off and grab onto two fleeing Fishes, ripping off their mouthparts and returning to the Minerva, now clutching a stuttering green ring of matter-energy in each hand.

The Black Getter looks up from where it and your R-Blade had been wreaking carnage on the fleeing alien mechs. "Can't you handle it, girl? We Men have more important things to do, like killing shit!"

You point an accusatory, grease-stained Tonfa at the larger mech. "Hey! I'll have you know that Killing Shit is just as important in a womans life as in a mans!"

The last of the alien mechs fall swiftly under the onslaught, only a handful making it to a warpout zone intact. The cargo arms of the DiNale snaffle up armloads of ring-catchers, as both Irregulars and Shadow Mirrors look on, perplexed.

Panicked crowds mill around the city, still dazed by what has just occurred. The three new mechs land in one of the least ruined squares, their ship framing them as cam-phones and data-capture pods swing to view them.

Intruiging...They're logging into the local internet and radio station frequencies. It seems they want to be heard.

"Yeah, they're not exactly low-key."

Kojiko's voice rings out across the city. "People of Earth, listen well! This attack is just the first strike from the alien menace! The Balmarians, scourge of the galaxy, have arrived, and they mean to enslave us all. Warn the rest of the planet! Don't let your governments ignore this mess!! Urge them to act, or incidents like this will continue! The aliens are in orbit around our moon, and are already preparing their next strike force! We will try to stop it, but its the duty of every citizen of earth to help against it! Call for the DC, who pledged to save Earth from them! Call for the Secret Weapons of the EFA, built to face such foes! Call for all the rebels who have weapons they can use to defend their mother planet! We, the Snipers, will be waiting for them to join the fight!"

...AAaaand their Facebook page just went live, along with a Twitter feed, three seperate 'unofficial' web forums, NeoCities account, pages on a dozen wikis, all uploaded from that artillery mech as the girl was talking....They were ready for this...

The three mechs then take off, landing on their ships deck as the last of the rescued and reconstituted humans climb down the ladders. A comm transmission comes at you. "Hey, Irregulars, got the time to hear us out?"

The blue ship leads the small fleet out onto open ground, towards a valley where the meeting can take place without more interruption. You spend the time working the comm, talking to other members of your group.

"Barshem, what the hell is going on? Why were your people there in the first place? What THE FUCK were you kidnapping people for?"

Bet Barshem looks annoyed, but with her helmet on its hard to tell to what degree. "Those were not Aerogater units, Katina Tarask. They were of Balmarian construction, but of a type not used in the Neviims standing complement. And with the Neviim as damaged as it was, we could not have constructed a force of that size so quickly, even with the schematics."

I think she's right, Katina. The Fish I analysed is definitely Balmarian technology, but there are definite differences between these drones and the ones we encountered before.

You raise an eyebrow. "Wait, so there are two sets of Balmarians here?"

It is potentially possible that Bet Barshem is lying and there were some special units stored on the Neviim, but I scanned 90% of its structure using the Bartolls and I saw nothing like these. And she is correct that while the Neviim could create such things, it was too damaged to construct an entire force this quickly, especially when they already have sizable forces already built. There being a second Balmarian force is more likely.

"Barshem, who could this force be?"

"I cannot say. The Neviim has detected no other Balmarian remnants for many lightyears around, and the nearest colony is in another quadrant of the galaxy. It seems inconceivable that any Balmarians entering the system would not contact the Neviim, or successfully hide from our sensors."

Yet I fear thats exactly whats happened. These things were definitely being controlled by Balmarian Hyperwave signals, and they weren't coming from the Neviim. As if we didn't have enough factions to deal with...

You ignore the responses coming from the Irregulars, set the comm to silent again and patch your earpiece into Dumi. "Ok, Dumi, I've got a plan. We're all going to go along with these guys, buy into their bullshit, and see where they're going with all this, while you act like the Spectical Jackass and question all their motives and point out their mistakes and all that shit. That way we can get on their good books and find out whats really going on."

Not a bad suggestion, but, surprise surprise, things are a little more complicated than that.

It may correspond with your meeting with them, Captain Onodera, but our experiences are much different.

Tetsuya looks aghast at Dumi. "Y-You mean you've met the Aerogaters here?"

Indeed. A scattered remnant of a shattered interstellar empire. Barely twenty thousand survivors, secreted inside an asteroid in cold sleep. A facility so damaged it can barely keep its own systems running. That is what I found in your solar system. No interstellar battlefleets, no superweapons, and no way they could win against the EFA if they provoked them in this fashion. So you'll excuse me for being sceptical of these claims."

Kojiko smiles thinly. "So you're accusing us of lying, Mr. Eye?"

I'm accusing you of saying something incorrect, no more, no less. There could be any number of reasons other than dishonesty. I'd hazard a guess that you have much the same reasons as the Irregulars have: Bias from previous encounters.

"Bias, you say? Thats a tad presumptous, given that they've already attacked the Earth twice. I'd say thats a trend, not a fluke."

And I'd say that you're misinterpreting the data. I can show you images of the Neviim, and the state its in. I can give you its entire mech complements with an error of less than 10%. It's not a world-conquering force, even in the slightest. Its enough to hold off a dedicated EFA attack for maybe a day or two, nothing more. I cannot ascribe to your theory, M'am, because it would only mean the Balmarians are suicidal.

Kojiko adjusts her glasses. "But we only have your word for that. I can show you data and footage from a dozen examples of Balmarian invasions, and of their previous attack on Earth, to corroborate the attack we saw here with our own eyes.

If we do, however, we need to taunt her about the fact that we actually got to use a Super Robot for a while, as opposed to being stuck in a Gespenst for two whole wars.

'not get in an argument' does not mean 'start an epic fistfight by taunting her' instead.
But we are Katina... and it does sound kinda fun...

Regardless, someone would wind up getting raped/doing the raping/etc.

Because KatinaxKatina is an OTP and you know it.

One of the Balmarian mechs themselves, which we recovered from the last battle. I've analysed it as far as my sensors will allow, and I am positive it was not created on the Neviim. It's design is very different, as the Irregulars sensors can tell, and the Neviim was not capable of building such mechs in the numbers we saw. Also, its hyperwave control signal was not locked onto the Neviim, but another point in Earth Sphere space. I can point out the features I'm talking about, and you may use your own sensors to determine the veracity. Also, the sensor logs on the Eurydice will still be under EFA security codes, which would make it difficult to tamper with them undetected. You can still find fault in the data if you wish, I'm simply pointing out, I would have to go to a lot of effort to falsify all of this. I would have to be central to this imagined Balmarian conspiracy. I'd have to be working every angle just to keep everything on track. Occams Razor would indicate the simpler explanation, that there are two sets of Balmarians at work here, is more worthy of investigation.

Tetsuya frowns. "A second set of Balmarians? Are you suggesting some kind of alien civil war is happening in the solar system?"

I'm not trying to imply what the relationship
between the two factions might be, but one is acting contrary to the interests of the other. I simply wish to state the case of the friendly faction, which does not desire conflict, so that it will not be mistakenly attacked.

Considering how things have unfolded so far, our situation has enough twists and reveals to qualify for Ace Pilottorney status.

Not neccesarily. Given that Vindel was allying with Yukiko, who is a xenophobic bitch, it makes sense that Baran would attack

Amuro stands up and turns to Dumi's monitor. "So what you're saying is that none of what you just said really matters. The Balmarians are still coming to attack this planet, its just that they've shoved some of their civilians out into the open as shields. That just shows how callous they are!"

...I'm forced to admit that the young Sir may have a point. Commander Laodicea of the Neviim claimed the Balmar fleet had left them hidden here and gone to find a suitable new homeworld for the Balmar race. It is concievable their own military has betrayed them, and unilaterally decided that conquering Earth is the more efficient option.

Amuro folded his arms smugly. "Well then, Mr Eye, you aren't much use except for stating the obvious, it seems."

"HOLD IT!" You leap up from your seat, pointing a dead-straight finger that sends the youth flinching back from across the table. "It does change things, buster! It means you just went from the enlightened saviours of earth to a bunch of jackasses that are going to get the last remnants of the Balmarian wiped out!! Your little broadcast to the masses will have the EFA pounding on the Neviim's hidey-hole, and our only hope for peace will be frenchfried! Meanwhile, the kidnappings will continue, since the true source of the drone attacks is hidden! Stick that up your pipe and blow it out your ass!!!"

Katina, I thought you said you were going to be the civil one this time...

Ryoma slams a fist on the table. "Well maybe the Balmar deserve that! Do you know how many species they've conquered, how many they've wiped out? You said they've been hit by a disaster, maybe it was just desserts for all the shit they've pulled!"

WILL KATINA KEEP UP HER TIRADE, OR WILL DUMI ATTEMPT TO SALVAGE THINGS? There are multiple strategies you can go for here, depending on who you want to be on the good side of afterwards.
