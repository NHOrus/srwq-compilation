# Episode 37

##SRWQ Mission 37: Murder and Molestation, just like a real family

In our last episode, Katina returned to the blasted remnants of the DC's African base, to find her allies bloodied but unbroken. Vindel Mauser reassumed command of the Shadow Mirrors, and decided to ally them with Yukiko Date, director of Project SRX, claiming that working with them to destroy the First and Only, then betraying them from within, was the clearest path to victory.

After this, Katina investigated the prisoner, Seolla Schweitzer, taken in the battle, only for her interrogation to be stopped by the reborn Arado Balanga, the man whose death got her expelled from the School.

Can Katina get through this personal crisis, while also saving the Shadow Mirrors as a whole?

---

"A family? Really Arado? You think the School was a family?" You start to laugh through the tears. "Families don't live in underground bunkers, training every day how to kill people! Families don't get their brains rewired every time they screw up! Families don't get their bones broken deliberately so they can grow back stronger!"

"That... That's not what I meant, Katina! I meant us, the students! We were the closest thing we'd ever get to a family! We had to band together, just to survive!"

"Yeah, and we did a fairly crappy job of it! What came of that loving household, huh? Look at us Arado! Seolla can't stand within 3 feet of another person. Latooni's a fucking robot who only shows emotion when she's in mortal danger! I'm... me! You're the only one close to a normal person, and you're a fucking zombie robot!"

"You're missing the point!! Dammit, Katina, it's not about what we are, it's... it's what we should be. We should be a family, we should try, at least. We can't just give up, and turn into the psychos they want us to be! We're... not that... Deep down, we're ok..."

"It was Latooni. She was the one who told me to 'handle' Seolla. She gave me the key to the cell, and told me to go nuts. Then she walked off like she'd just given me a payslip."

"Ugh... but..."

"We are psychos, Arado. After going through the School... Anyone who wasn't a psycho would be dead."

Arado's face is a tornado of emotions. He glares back and forth between you, the cell, and Seolla curled up in the corner. Then he grunts and storms off, leaving you alone with the girl sobbing under the blanket.

"Oh... Seolla, I'm sorry..."

The thing under the blanket continues to squeak.

"I just... I don't know what to do with you... Ever since... Ouka and Arado... I haven't been able to think straight about you all. I... don't want to hurt now, I just... I want to be sure of things, and that makes me go overboard."

"..m'okay, m'okay, I'm o-kay..."

You move to give the girl a reassuring cuddle, then realise this would make her worse. You content yourself to sit down beside Seolla as she finally pokes her head out of the blanket.

"Uh, Seolla... What did happen after I left? What have I missed?"

"Latooni and I graduated. She was broken out of the facility, I was send onto the Project. Spend months testing Radom Group units and the R-0. Arado was shipped to the Shocker project for... revival. Assumed I'd never see him again. Sister Ouka... she became top ace. Best pilot in the Project that wasn't one of the Special Class. Everything she ever dreamed up of being... but she was lonely."

"Lonely? Her? She would have surrounded herself with sychophants and fangirls, same as she always did!"

"She... couldn't. After what happened... She missed Arado too much. Even with me, and the Riksent girl, she never opened up. Started wearing a mask, using a codename. Tried to become a different person."

"...Yeah. All psychos. just like I said."

You pick yourself up and head down the corridor. She whispers back. "I-I'll just stay in the cell... better there."

"..Fine."

---

The Granzon ceases glowing, as the radiance around the new crater fades away. The pile of rubble that had been the DC's headquarters building has ceased to exist, as has a vast chunk of earth and concrete. The top layer of the DCs secret underground bunker is exposed.

"Impertinent fool!" The Thrudgelmir still looks half-melted, and turns stiffly from the point where it tried to shield the bunker, its feet still fused to the concrete slabs it was standing on. "I will not have you firing off black holes at Magus. I would have retrieved her myself, had you but waited!"

Shuu barely glances at the masked man in the comm window. "There is more at stake here than simply one woman and her computer system, Wodan Ymir. This bunker not only contains veteran DC personnel, but the last traces of Inspector technology not in EFA hands, and the only being who understands how to use it. We will require all of these things in the near future."

Figures start to climb out of the crater. The grey-skinned figure of Sophia Nate helps the glossy-skinned Aquija up over the ladder. Nearby, Lily Junkers and Manami Hamill look over their heads, seeking someone conspicously absent from the emerging crowd...

"Hey, Dumi! Do you still have that wierd Crystal stuff you got off the aliens?"

*Yes, only a few kilograms. I could make it self-replicate if I could just figure out its intrinsic programming...*

"Get those science-heads to help! I'm sure Sophia will know what to do, she made the Machine Cells after all!"

*Perhaps... But there are a few more issues from that bunker we might want to deal with.*

"What kind of issues?"

*Well, theres the matter of free time. I don't think Sophia is going to get much lab time before the Team-up, what with having to meet Ms Browning and come to a proper arrangement. I can potentially boost her brainpower a few times using the ODE technique and the homonculi, but I doubt a breakthrough would come as quickly as you'd hope.*

"We can still try, can't we? Maybe we can get some more people to help."

*I'm not finished. Theres also the issue of scientific secrecy, i.e., keeping this technology out of the hands of non-Shadow Mirrors, including the ELF, Junkers, Aquija and especially the SRX people. If we wanted her to develop this technology, we'd need to set her up in a lab away from the rest of us and only contact her via the mindlink.*

"Ugh, ok, that's annoying but not too bad."

*Except we'd need a lab, and the hyperwave isn't 100% reliable anymore, remember?*

"Surely Vindel and Lemon will see the advantages of letting her do this."

*Not while theres a simpler solution that already exists: The False Cells. They're already there. Vat Tran has made Sophia create self-reproduction chambers and energy absorbers for them, and she's half-done on a programing interface. They've already gotten enough to retrofit a dozen mechs, easily. Asking Vindel to hold off on using them while Sophia perfects the Cells would be like asking him not to set a man on fire until you can him fume-free petrol to do it with. He won't appreciate the difference, not under the current time constraints.*

You rub your chin completatively. "So you think Vindel'll just use them as they are, on our mechs?"

*Yes. By the time Sophia has created 'real' machine cells, whatever form they take, the entire Shadow Mirror force will likely be equipped with a secret cache of them. Enough to optimise their systems and keep them running in the fight against the First. Then, when the time comes to fight SRX again, he'll have them all transform to new forms like the Thrudgelmir for the final fight. It's too perfect a plan for him to ignore because of what, comparative to the 'salvation' of Earth, are small issues.*

"Small issues? You said they run on negative emotions! On pain and suffering!"

*Thats just one of their power sources, but yes. And do you think telling that to Vindel, who's dedicated to a world of eternal conflict and thinks the struggles of humanity are a good thing, will make him like them less?*

"Ugh..."

*Katina... I thought you beleived in that world too. I thought you wanted to fight eternally, to make mankind struggle towards perfection. Is it so easy to make you doubt that? One new technology that turns a metaphor into fuel, and suddenly you feel like a vampire?*

"I don't know... I've seen a lot of stuff in the past while, Dumi. I've seen a lot of people suffer. I've caused suffering, and I've suffered myself. And I'm not sure if I like the fallout of war as much as I thought I would."

*A natural human response. An ideal which seems to benefit the greater good in theory conflicted with inbuilt morality in practise. Empathy and ambition, two opposing forces that shape the human condition...*

"Not to mention this war seems likely to destroy humanity entirely."

*A more practical concern, perhaps. There are indeed several possibilities for species-wide destruction in play here. We could work to reduce them, if we're going to stay here...*

"Not this again..."

*Merely reminding you of the options. Hey, isn't that Lemon Browning?*

The Shadow Mirrors second-in-command is indeed coming towards the crater, and she doesn't look happy, at all.


"Heeey, Ms Browning... You're a scientist, right?"

Lemon looks at you as if you had three heads, one made of dogshit and one made of vomit. It's the first time you've seen her genuinely angry, her face normally a facade of total calm or bemusement.

"Er... is this a bad time?"

"Enough stalling on your part, Tarask. I want to know exactly what you people have been up to while we were gone. How did you manage to activate W-BC-01? What is the DC hiding? What is this winged balloon thing thats hovering over the base? And when are you going to tell us about these aliens you've been hinting about all this time?!!"

Yup, definitely mad. But not at you specifically, you think.

"His names Arado Balanga, not W-B-X-whatever."

"I can't find myself caring too much. How is he active? His nervous system had degraded past the point of adaptation to his cyborg implants, how did you repair it?"

"Yeah, thats what I wanted to talk to you about. We met someone called Sophia Nate, from the DC, who discovered something called Machine Cells. They can fix mechs and people, and power them up, but they're still not stable. She said she needs more time to get them perfected, but Vat Tran forced her to make the flawed versions. I... We need you to ask Vindel to hold off on using them, until we can get them to work properly. Or even not tell him at all until they're safe."

"Right. Given that all the control failsafes on W-BC-01 have failed, I can see what you mean about instability."

"Arado. AH-RAH-DOHHH."

She ignores you. "Is that all of the DCs equipment I should know about?"

"Pretty much... They said their alien might have a dimensional scanner to look for disturbances, but that's kinda moo-"

"Disturbances like teleporting alien troops, and the Irregulars?"

"Uh... I dunno, I guess, you'd have to ask the alien."

"I shall. What about the balloo-"

"Can't you just call for the little girl in the red mech?"

Lemon has already drawn back her fist before she catches herself. It takes a visible effort for her to unclench it. "We are not discussing that, Tarask!! Now tell me about this damned balloon-thing!!"

"The 'balloon', and I think 'mutant turkey' is a better description-"

*Hey!!!*

"-is Dumi, and he's an interdimensional traveller, who's following the Irregulars, since they have something he wants."

"Hold on, Dumi? As in our D.U.M.I. experiment for the DGG project?"

"Er, yeah. He sorta was hiding out in TLI, and decided to give you guys a hand with your AI project, and the next thing you know, he decided he likes the Shadow Mirrors, and is going to become the DGG04 to help us fight injustice!"

"..."

"He's on our side, really!"

"We'll see. What does he know about the First?"

*As much as you do, Miss Browning. I'm afraid I'm as in the dark about them as you, although I can help you infer things from the facts at hand.*

"Hmmph, charmer. And Project SRX? What more do you know of it?"

*Now theres an interesting story...

I won't bore you with the details just yet, but I will summarize things. While I was searching your world for the Key I was looking for, I encountered a race called the Balmarians, entering your solar system by subtle methods. At the time I didn't know they were refugees, so I acted rashly and provoked them to violence. I was forced to attack the core of their ship, where I found a human who was being used as the core of their ultimate weapon, Judecca.*

Lemon blinks "A human?"

*Yes. It seems the Balmarians had been abducting samples from Earth for some years, investigating the abilities of humans, before disaster struck their homeworld and forced them to seek refuge. One type of human they were particularly interested in where known as Psychodrivers.*

"Psychic humans? Those are only rumored, no-ones done any serious research on them in years!"

*Since Dr. Kenzo Kobayashi dissappeared, am I right?*

"Er..yes."

*Dr. Kobayashi is in Izu Base right now, building his theories into weapons for Project SRX. The reason Psychodrivers haven't appeared in any public scientific research is because the EFAs School programme has been snatching up all potential Psychodrivers on your world. The entirety of human knowledge on these beings and thier potential is contained in one place, the most protected place on Earth. Even Mrs Kobayashi, the girl I took from Judecca, was stationed there, and snuck out under cover of a lab accident.*

"My my..."

*Which reminds me, I really should figure out what I'm going to do with her. Despinis and Enfield can't keep her on the Eurydice forever.*

Lemon tilts her head quizzically. "So why were you interested in Psychodrivers anyway?"

*Er... My main body was disabled by a psychic feedback loop from the Judecca, which placed both it and the Balmarian planetoid into stasis. Being un-initiated into human mental abilities, I sought refuge in TLI and had... my allies investigate the energy patterns involved. Izu Base was the only area where we found it, but we couldn't gain full access. Luckily, an alternate method of freeing myself arose, which also freed the Balmarians.*

"A happy ending then."

*Hardly, since now we have thousands of aliens to worry about.*

"And you still need your key."

*Yes.*

"Well, how are we to deal with these newly awakened Balmarians?"

*They sent a contact to us, one Bet Barshem, to accompany us back. And if I'm not mistaken, she's a meeting with Vindel right now.*

Lemon glances back at the Trilobite at this, a hurt expression on her face, but then turns back. "And the alien technology, is it better than that Vat Tran was using?"

*Theres more of it, certainly. But in this case, we have to ask. Not to say Aquija's little treasure trove can't be of some use.*

"Um, Dumi, about the crystals?"

*Oh yes. Ms. Browning, I did claim some samples of the Balmarians most advanced technology, and I beleive you and Dr. Nate may wish to look at them. They may hold the key to creating the perfected Machine Cells... or even more.*

"Intruiging... I beleive I need to inspect the DC's labs anyway, perhaps Dr. Nate could set up and experiment there?"

*I'll ask Cynthia, her assistant, to pick up the sample and get things organised. I do hope this is the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship.*

"As do I, Dumi."

You watch as the Bergelmir flies to Dumi to retreive the crystal, and Lemon begins to talk to Sophia and Aquija. You feel a slight pang of jealousy at Dumi finding these new people to occupy his time, but then, it was you who insisted on it.

You start walking back towards the Trilobite.

###SLIGHTLY ELSEWHERE

"Latooni... Did you tell Katina to torture Seolla."

The girl doesn't even turn around. "I find it interesting, Balanga, that you've been awake for most of a day, and yet you haven't talked to anymore except the woman who killed you. That sounds like an unhealthy fixation."

"Answer my question!"

"...I didn't think someone as weak as Seolla has worth my time."

"Wh... What do you mean?"

Latooni turns around, adjusting her glasses. "Theres no hidden meaning there, Balanga. Seolla is a bit player in the SRX project, a glorified grunt. My time would be wasted trying to get any information out of her, or to convince her to join the rabble here. So I decided to kill two birds with one stone, and keep that silly woman out of my hair for a while. She has quite the obsession with me, you know."

Arado stands there, mute, his hands quivering.

"Have I angered you, Balanga?"

"How can you... be so damned cold?"

"Because the School trained me that way, Balanga. Just like they trained you to be a spoiler."

"What?"

"Someone who ruins things. Who smashes up the dynamic. When Bronzo Class was disbanded, they put you in the same class as me and Ouka, not to help you improve, but to break up the dynamic. To shatter the peace of the class and destroy the ties we'd made together. And you did it wonderfully, by dying like you did."

The girl slams against the back wall, with Arado's hand around her throat. "LIAR!! You can't know that!!! That... thats not.."

"... *Cough* Lidl'mor..."

"Whu..."

"...Squeeze... a little more... and you'll pop my second and third verterbrae... I'll die instantly... Go on, finish your mission..."

Arado snaps back his hand like Latooni was on fire. She drops to her feet and stands up, as if nothing had happened.

"Heh-heh... close one, Balanga. I'll have to be more careful around you in future."

Arado stares at her, then at his hands. Then he runs off.

---

"Rio, they still making you do all the work around here?" You half-heartedly play with a spanner set as you talk to the overworked mechanic."

"Y-yeah... Ryo was laid up with a concussion, and I sh... Johnathan got hit by stray fire during the EFA raid. If it wasn't for the Other Arado, I'd be like them as well, and probably captured to boot."

"Well, thank god for Robot Hellghosts, then!"

"Er, yeah..."

"So, how are we looking for mechs?"

"Ugh... I wish you hadn't asked..."

---

```
Trilobites 1 and 2: Intact thanks to Dumi. Repaired from the sabotage.
Soulgain: Still busted
Vysaga: In shreds. The parts were recovered, but theres no realistic way to repair it... by conventional means anyway.
Bluepenst: Ok
Redpenst: Caught the edge of the HTB cannon, it practically had to be peeled off the Huckebien. Theres even less left than there was of the pilot.
Huckebien EX: Badly damaged, but the core systems are ok. However, repairing the frame will be difficult without the proper facilities (which are at the Moon Cradle).
Rathgrith: Ok
Angelg: Fine after repairs.
R-Blade: Fine after repairs.
StealthRaubtier:...

"Yeah, we're... still trying to figure this one out."
```
---

Latooni looks on grimly at the scene before her. "Why wasn't I informed of this?"

Rio shrugs. "We only found it a few hours ago. And we had no clue what it was."

The clump of mech parts blindly slithers about the charred jungle, pseudopods snaking about, gathering pieces of shrapnel and the odd screw. Arms, legs, wings and the half-heads of the StealthRaubtier and StealthFalken jut from it at odd angles. The metal monstrosity appears to be a junkyard brought to life.

*Intruiging... I would have expected the Machine Cells to go dormant after Latooni self-destructed, but apparently they're more resilient than I expected. They're still attempting to repair the mech. Unfortunately, damaged as they are, they can't tell which mech is which.*

You frown at the blind thing. "Can we... fix it?"

The cells are truly one with that scrap, no removing them. The only option is to finish the repair process, but that means giving the cells energy and some more material to work with. But the results could be interesting, if I can repair the programming.

---

"You sure about this?" Rio says as the hover-rig dumps the corpse of the Vysaga in front of the shambling mass.

"Well it ain't like we have any other use for it."

"I dunno, I thought maybe the parts could be used on the Soulgain, somehow."

*The Soulgain and the Vysaga don't have the same compatability that the original Earthgain and Vairose had. They were optimised for different battle roles and thus have quite different components. Now, we just need an energy source.*

You return to base and fetch the Raioh. Dumi hovers over the mass as it slowly soaks into the Vysaga parts. *Programming links established... extrapolating potential configurations... Oh!*

"What?" You ask as you charge up the Plasma Converter.

*A lull in the storm... I  think I'll use my Crosstiem Correspondence Driver like I did with the Bergelmir... Yes, the Irregulars universe has something we can use.*

Plasma flies from the Raioh to Dumi, who converts it into waves warmth that soak into the machine cells. They begin to frantically divide and multiply, turning black as they perform their final duty.

Slowly, but surely, as the False Cells sacrifice themselves, the final form of the new mech takes shape.

*Well... what do you think?*

You grin. "It looks... rapey."

---

###ELSEWHERE

The thing stand on the Neviims hangar deck, towering over the Zachariahs and Ezekiels around it. It vaguely resembles their aesthetic, except for the horns, and claws, and the fanged mouth with occasionally snarls, revealing the whole thing to be empty...

Laodicea grimaces at the monstrous thing. He looks to his left and sees Armana looking enthralled. He coughs, and speaks into the comm unit. "You are the representative of the First that we asked for?"

A grumbling voice, from nowhere in particular, though it made the air in the room vibrate. "I AM OF THE FIRST EMOTIONS, SPEAKING FOR THE REGISSEURS. BEFORE WE BEGIN, WE MUST DEMAND YOU DO NOT APPEAR ON EARTH SUDDENLY AS YOU DID IN GENEVA, UNTIL THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMPLETE."

Laodicea nods, looking at Baran Doban out of the corner of his eye. If the old general had any misgivings about his actions, he wasn't showing it. "So do we promise. Now, to the matter at hand. We, the last survivors of Balmar, require a safe place to put the survivors of our world. There are few available planets that we can colonise, and none of our ships remain. We request that efforts be made to have safe asylum on your world."

"A SIMPLE, BUT DIFFICULT REQUEST. STABILITY ON 'OUR' WORLD IS THREATENED, BY HUMAN FACTIONS THAT SEEK TO DISTRUPT PROPER ORDER. THE EARTH IS CURRENTLY SAFE FOR NO BEING, BALMARIANS EVEN LESS SO."

"That was our understanding as well. So the question becomes... can we be of mutual benefit?"

"THE FIRST ARE NO WARMONGERS, LAODICEA OF BALMAR. WE PREFER SIMPLE INTEGRATION AND BENIGN PACIFICATION OF UNRULY ELEMENTS. IF YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP US CLEANSE THIS WORLD OF SUCH ELEMENTS, YOUR SIMILARITY TO HUMANITY WILL ALLOW FOR INTEGRATION OF YOUR POPULACE. WE CAN EVEN ENSURE YOUR AUTONOMY."

Laodicea grins. "Then, First Emotion, it seems we may have the beginnings of a deal."

---

###ELSEWHERE, BUT NOT AS ELSEWHERE AS YOU THINK

"Well done, Skywalker!" Ryoma clips Amuro's ear. "Almost flew us straight into Pluto. Remind me why I let you pilot this thing again?"

Amuro rubs his ear. "Hey, lay off, Ryo! You're lucky I got this hunk of crap through before the storm picked up again! A few para-seconds more and we've have been crushed in the anti-flow!"

"It was your idea to risk the transition, moonboy."

"And your dumb plan to enter the storm in the first place!"

"Guys! Hush!" Kojiko looks out over her glasses at the two bickering young men. "DiNales picking up a transmission. Someone's picked us up?"

"Already?" Ryoma scratches his head, "But we just translated in, how could anyone in a Type-4 universe find us this fast??"

Kojiko grimaces. "Maybe its not a Type-4 anymore... Maybe thats whats causing the storms... Patching it through!"

The four-eyed mask regards the DiNale's bridge and the three young people. *Greetings, travellers, and welcome to our universe! I apologise for the intrusion, but I happened to be in the area while testing one of my Crossgate Transciever devices, and I noticed you translating out of the aether. I couldn't pass up an oppurtunity to meet genuine Timedivers.*

Amuro looks up at the viewscreen. "Who are you? What do you want with us?"

*My name is Euzeth Gozzo, and I'm a man with many problems. You see, my species recently met with misfortune, and an incompetent relative of mine has been placed in charge of the survivors. He intends to ally himself with a race of alien conquerors, who are invading the planet known as Earth. Unwittingly, he is dooming our species to servitude under the yoke of these monstrosities, and I cannot in good conscious let him do so. But, to end his foolish way, I'll need allies, go-betweens between the people of Earth and myself, and world-wise individuals like yourselves might be just who I require.*

Ryo raises an eyebrow. "So you're offering us a job, then? Whats the payment?"

*My dear fellow, once my people are saved, you may have the pick of this universes greatest artefacts. Whatever you can fit into your cargo holds, is yours for the taking.*

Ryoma grins. "Now that's an offer we Treasure Snipers can appreciate..."
