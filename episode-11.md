Roster:

Katina Tarask, the frilly-dressed psychodere, piloting the Raioh.
Dumi, an AI who is almost too helpful to Katina, piloting/is the still un-named DGG-04.
Irm, the theoretical leader of this band of misfits, piloting a Gespenst because there was no room for our Grungust-tank in the Trilobite.
Kai, has pretty much supplanted Irm as leader even though his true allegiance is unknown. Trying to convert a spare Gespenst into something more impressive.
Russel: An irish spy for the Shadow Mirrors. Puts up with Katina more than most on the ship. Piloting a Gespenst with Blade Tonfas.
Latooni, a cold calculating girl who has defected from the EFA apparently to challenge herself. Piloting the Soldifar, a wierd Real Robot produced by a european company called Freemont Industries and used by the Earth's Liberation Front.
Arado: One of the pilots from the other universe, come to stop Vindel Mauser from leading Dark Brain to their universe. Resembles one of Katinas old friends, causing issues. Has been entrusted with a Guarlion Custom.
Ibis Douglas: A young woman who only joined the Shadow Mirror to find a friend of hers. Loves guns of all sizes, on both her mechs and her own person. Piloting a Schutzwald, but is holding out for something with more dakka.
Echidna Iasakki: A cold woman in charge of the W-series, a set of wierd pods that apparently hold reconstructed pilots loyal to Shadow Mirror. Pilots a Rathgrith.
????: The group is still a pilot short for the WildRaubtier they captured from the EFA. Echidna says she can sort this out, given time.

"Wait, so the chainsaws are mounted on the back of the Boost Knuckles?"

You nod happily at Irm. "Yup, and they can pop out and you can do a Boost Chainsaw Knuckle attack!"

"...and then you...combine the chainsaws into a sword??? How???"

Johnathan looks up from his scribblings, a smile on his face for the first time in a while. "Well, it'll be an engineering challenge, but I think I can rig up a connector on one blade and a hilt on the other. It's the superheating and lightning effects that'll be the real problem."

You stomp your foot. "Oh come on! Those are the most important part!"

Irm chuckles lightly. "Well, if we can make the Ragouken and the Doomblade, we should be able to figur-" He stops and picks up his bleeping comm. "Yes? Huh? Axel??? I'll be right there!"

Irm rushes to the bridge, with you hot on his heels.

"...Once we got clear of the central US, we didn't run into any more trouble, but its possible the EFA are still tracking us. With all these wounded here, we'd prefer an escort if possible."

Irm nods at Axel's report. "Right. We're not far from Brasilia now, so we can send some of our people ahead and prepare our outpost to recieve the wounded, while we link up with you and return."

Latooni nods. "A viable strategy. I shall have to go to Brasilia, I'm the only one who knows the people running the outpost. But I'll need an escort for safety."

Kai nods. "Until that kid Ryoto finishes the overhaul on my mech, I'm better off on foot. I'll go to Brasilia."

Irm nods. "Anyone else volunteering?"

You pipe up. "Ugh, I just had a thought. Isn't it nearly Lent?"

"....Yyyyeeeeesss. So?"

"Well....doesn't that mean its Mardi Gras season?"

Irm facepalms hard.

Rules don't mention a lot of things that are allowed, that means almost nothing is allowed? I hate when people talk about "cancer" and sage and act like retarded tough guys. You always hear that fanfiction is "gaiafaggotry" and "cancer" on /a/ and ED and decided you'll be just like the cool guys and show you're real tough who fights against "cancer", huh? Nobody cares. It doesn't bother anybody, for example I haven't even noticed that there were ten threads about this already.

The Amazon river runs wide and deep, enough that the Trilobite can navigate underwater without disturbing the few riverboats it encounters. Coming up to an abandoned quay in the middle of Brasilia, an extending airlock worms it way out of the water, and disgorges you, Kai and Latooni. The noise of the festival can be heard several blocks away.

Latooni adjusts her glasses. "We should head north and check their offices first. They should still be there, even today."

"But if they're not, we totally have to go look for them in the party, right?"

Latooni frowns at you. "That would most likely be an incredible waste of time."

"All the best parties are!"

Latooni sighs and walks off, leading the two of you into the city.

Dodging samba dancers, dodgy food stalls, and wayward drunken revellers, you eventually arrive at a non-descript office building on the outskirts of one of the nicer districts. The building obviously has tenants, being intruigingly furnished from what you see in the windows, but there are no signs of life and no answers from the doorbell.

Latooni sighs. "They should be more responsible than this. They must not even realise what happened yesterday, to be going off like this."

"Oh well, nothing else for it, we'll just have to brave the crowds. Better get started, its nearly nighttime."

"That's too reckless, we can't..."

You're already hopping down the street towards the nearest noise.

"...We shouldn't have let her come."

"Don't worry kid." Kai starts to walk off after you. "I'll keep an eye on her while you track down some more leads. I'll have my radio on. Be careful."

Latooni nods, and walks up the street.
Kai find you in the thick of the main street parade, negotiating angrily with a street vendor over his exorbitant real-to-EFACU exchange rate.

"Kai, can I borrow a few dollars off you? I just need a few essentials." You say, patting the armful of plastic bead necklaces you're carrying.

"I won't pretend to be the most worldly of men, but isn't the whole Mardi Gras Beads thing a New Orleans tradition, not a Brazilian one?"

"Well then why would they be on sale?"

"The fact that you're willing to pay this man 37 'facs for a dozen cheap necklaces might have something to do with it."

You don't answer Kai immediately, because something odd just caught your eye.

Ryuune Zoldark, wearing half-cutoff jeans and a white tanktop, her hair done up with a hairband, has just come out of an alleyway on the other side of the street.

"Hey!! Miss Zoldark!! Over here!!"

Ryuune turns to you as you run over, and her face twists in confusion as to what she's seeing.

"How did you get here so fast? Your base didn't have a secret mega-fast ship, did it?....No, what am I thinking? You must have snuck onto our ship? Why the secrecy?"

"Er...you have the wrong person." She says in the same accent and diction as the DC leader. "I...I just have one of those faces, I guess. Now if you'll excuse me, I have someone to find." She turns on her heel and jogs off without another word.

Kai comes up to you. "If that's our Ryuune Zoldark, then I'm got three eyeballs under this patch. That must be the other version, they mentioned they were missing some of thier number. We have to see what her story is!"

WILL KATINA FOLLOW RYUUNE, AND HOW HARD WILL SHE CHASE HER?

You're wearing a red dress with white frills, green-and-red Zettai Ryouki tights, and a bonnet attached to your hair with pink ribbons.

You're not out of place in the Mardi Gras environment, but you're relatively distinctive if someone is watching out for you.

Kai is wearing a borrowed shirt and loose pants, but the eyepatch is a giveaway. This is Brasilia, not Madripoor.

"Come back here! We want to talk to you!!!" You run full-tilt after the new Ryuune, who accelerates to full stride without pause.

She runs much faster than someone wearing those kinds of shoes should be able to.

"Stop!! *Huff* Listen!! *huff* We're with the *huff* DC, we know your friends!! *huff*"

"Katina , that's *puff* not the sort of thing *puff* you shout on the street!"

You chase Ryuune into a small park, filled with floats and other paraphenalia for the parade later tonight. She comes to a halt near a large float, of a giant woman in wierd white armor. You flop up to her, gasping for breath.

"Okay, who the hell are you? How do you know about me? And what do you want?"

"Arado is with you?? How did that happen?"

"It's a long story, but basically, he was a prisoner of the DC, and some of your friends managed to talk to the DC and get them to cooperate on this search for Mauser. We're...independents with the DC, and we're trying to get away from the trouble at TLI and start this search."

"Can I talk to Arado now?"

"He's currently on our battleship, which is rendevousing with some friends of ours off the coast."

You dry your eyes and pipe up. "I wanted to bring him along, but when I suggested he buy me some beads he ran and hid in a closet."

"...He'll be more use back on the ship."

Ryuune looks back and forth at the two of you. "Well, I suppose I have to trust someone here, but I'm not committing to anything until I confirm your story. Besides, I have someone to find here."

"In the city? Who could that be?"

"Japanese boy, 18. Wears a silver jacket. Should have two cats following him around."

"This is Mardi Gras season, that's not nearly wierd enough for him to stand out here."

The red-headed woman carefully leans down, to keep the baby in her arms as still as possible. "Are these your...friends, Latooni?"

"Two of them are. I wasn't expecting the one in the jeans."

"I t'ought you sed this was priority one stuff." says the thickly-accented black man. "Why dey bringin' in new people now?"

"I'd extrapolate that this girl is highly involved with the incident in question, and they stumbled across her."

Ryuune blinks and shakes her head. "This is too much...you're all so familiar..."

Kai smirks. "No offense, girl, but you're the spitting image of the head of the DC. Now, I think we need to find a more private venue."

"Gone? How can they be gone?" Garnet's indignant expression is one thing, but the fact that's she's breastfeeding her child at the same time is what really makes the scene awkward. Kai seems genuinely discomfitted for the first time since you've met him.

Latooni speaks up first. "Mausers plan required extensive secrecy, even the troops stationed at TLI did not know the nature of the retreat until a few days beforehand. Outer cells like yours would have been alerted by time-delayed message after the jump, and adviced to join up with ELF remnants and await an eventual return in several years."

You turn your head sideways quizzically. "How do you know that, Subota? I thought you were just one of the grunts."

"I extrapolated the plan from the limited information we were told and by analysing the types of preperations we were making."

Kai coughs awkwardly. "Re...regardless of that, things went badly. The jump was a failure, and most of the military strength of the Shadow Mirrors lost. Those that remain are in a bad way. We managed to gather what units and soldiers we could, and they don't have anywhere to go but here."

"What we talkin' 'bout here? We run safehouses, warehouses, dat kinda t'ing. What do you need from us?"

"Most likely...all of it. Now."

AXELQUEST MISSION 2 START

The Trilobite rocks violently from side to side, as sea-to-air missiles burst all around it. The Angelg's Shadow Lances, the Vysagas throwing knives, and the Soulgains Seiryurin shoot down those that may actually hit. In the distance, the Killer Whale surfaces, launching another wave of missiles.

"Hrgnh! The EFA sure knew what to pinch from the DC. Even our sonar didn't give us more than 30 seconds warning. Mickey, where's our backup??"

Ensign Michael Govod checks his console and breaks out into a sweat. "The other Trilobite is at 40 kilometers and closing, ETA 3 minutes!! But I've got another contact on the scopes, a Tausendfuessler coming out from the Mexico coast! It'll arrive around the same time!!"

"Th-th-this is illogic-ical, they should not h-have been able to dete-ect us in time to i-i-intercept."

"Well they did!! So shut up and get rid of those missiles!" The Soulgains hands are like blue stars, and constant streams of energy burst from them to tear through the incoming salvoes.

She's right though. We've done a dozen operations in Trilobites just like this and the EFA have never found us before it was too late. How did they manage to predict our course this time?

Brooklyn fires off the last of his knives. "Major, we won't get very far simply bearing their slings and arrows. I suggest we sally forth, and show them our steel!!"

"Y-yes s-sir."

"Allons-y!" Brooklyn goes first, slicing at passing missiles as he goes, but Axel's burst of speed soon overtakes him, as he crashes through the missile salvos, heedless of the superficial damage they might cause his Soulgain.

The Killer Whale pauses in its bombardment, and its hangars open. A half-dozen Gespensts and the same in Sealions emerge, heading towards the two over the water.

"Man, these EFA guys really don't get it, do they?"

"You don't send Gespensts out to fight Super Robots! It's just a waste of my time!!!"

Arm-blades extended, Axel boosts into the enemy formation, bullets and missiles pinging off him. Two Gespenst become four useless pieces. A trooper fired a mega beam rifle into the Soulgains forearm. The mark is gone by the time the arm flies through his torso. Another goes for a Jet Magnum, but the glowing fist meets the other rotating arm, and is torn off by the impact.

"Sometimes I think the EFA bigwigs get off on casualty numbers. It's the only explanation for why they keep making me kill these poor bastards!"

The last two boost backwards desperately, their frenzied shooting not even a threat.

Behind, the sea churns into a waterspout as the Vysagas blade releases the power of the wind. Sealions are tossed about like fish in a punching bag. Three are thrown into the air, and in three brief flashes, are cut to ribbons.

"Show-off."

"It's a warriors duty to show a lesser opponent his folly."

The Killer Whale starts to submerge again.

"Heh...what a time to feel nostalgic."

"Sir?"

"Head back to the Trilobite, I'm going to end this charade! GENBU GOUDAN!!!"

The Soulgains arms fly off, but not spinning as they normally do. As the hatches of the Killer Whale begin to seal, the arms catch one and wrench it open, before reattaching to the Soulgain as it boosts through the gap.

Brooklyn watches as the seconds tick past, and the Killer Whale continues to submerge, rocking in the relatively calm sea as if it were sailing in a typhoon. After about a minute, all goes quiet.


Then the Soulgain burst out of the other hangar door, and boost-jumps back towards the Trilobite, as the Killer Whale starts to sink a little faster than it was designed to.

"Ok, who's next?"

"Brooks, take the front one! Lamia, keep those new models off my back, I'm going for that sniper!"

The three charge into the fray, as a torrent of railgun rounds fly at them. Lamia takes several rounds, even the speedy Vysaga takes a few, and the Soulgain picks up mark after mark as 3 units fire on them.

"Ngh! Finally, the EFA sends some proper units to deal with us!"

A brace of missiles fly from the Trilobite into the enemy formation, but the EFA pilots dodge expertly, only two taking superficial damage.

"Per-performance is well a-above standar-rd mass-production le-evels, approaching th-that of the Type-R Gesp-spenst prototype."

"They'll need it. Now blow them away, Doll!"

Lamia's bow launched bolt after bolt of plasma, but even with Lamia's archery skills, the R-series manages to stay safe, returning fire. A round cracks off the side of Angelgs head, taking a sizable chunk of armor. Twisting away, Lamias Shadow Lance leaps out and catches one as it reloads, puncturing the torso and sending it smoking into the Gulf of Mexico.

"Ngh!" Brooklyn grimaces as another railgun round strikes his normally untouchable machine. "You have some talent, I must say!"

Shine grins. "It's a simple matter for one such as I to see through those simplistic after-images. But I suppose you want a real fight?"

Brooklyn draws his blade, the metal almost alive with the lust for battle. "That would be quite sporting of you, indeed."

"Very well. But you should know, my victory has already been foretold." The R-Blade stows its railgun and draws its tonfas with a flourish

"Has it now? Well, I shall have to make a good account of myself, regardless."


The normal railgun rounds were annoying, but not a great threat. It was the heavy rounds coming from the black mech that Axel actually felt. Each one was actually cracking his armor, and despite his speed and twisting charge, she seemed to be able to hit the same area repeatedly.

"Uugh! You're pretty good at what you do, buddy, but I'm the best there is."

The voice is a young womans, muffled as if through a gasmask or something. "Really, Mr. Almer? I thought Beowulf held that distinction at the minute."

"Oh, you did not just go there..."

"Don't worry, the blue bullhead will soon be surpassed, but not by the likes of you."

The beam hits the Soulgain right in the optic sensors, and dislodges one of the forehead antennae. Momentarily blinded, Axel strikes blindly, only for a shot to come from behind. The beam smashes through the weakened shoulder armor, and the left shoulderpad of the Soulgain cracks off.

"I am the Black Knight, and I will win the Tournament of Aces. Surrender, Axel Almer, and you may let live to see the defeat of Beowulf and his ilk."

The Angelg boosts through the air, after-images glimmering around it, and stabs forward with its Mirage Sword, taking the arm and leg off another R-0. The other 4 flit around, boosters and Tesla drives straining, as the Angelg ups the ante.

"El-eliminating target th-three!"

One of the pilots mistakenly flies too far from his allies, and suddenly finds himself surrounded by a half-dozen Angelgs. Barely keeping his cool, he rapid-fires his overheating railgun at each of them, but the true Angelg strikes him from above, and his mech explodes.

"P-proceedi-ing to tar-rget f-fou-"

A R-Series mech rams its glowing fist into the Angelgs side, and then grabs its sword arm, firing its head vulcans at the damaged. Lamia lashes out, and punches the things head off, then slices it in two as it drops off, but its too late.

The final two R-0s point their railguns and fire at pointblank range. The front of the Angelgs torso caves in.

The Soulgain and the Schwartzritter dance across the sky, Soulgain scoring little more than scratches as the Oxtongue rifle chips away at it.

"Black Knight? Seriously, are you mocking me?"

"You're not the Dark Knight of the EFA anymore, Almer. You chose to abandon your duty and seek a new path. You can't expect to keep your title after doing that."

"Who the hell do you think you are, girl? You talk about surpassing aces like me and Beowulf, but I've never even heard of you before? Do you think you can make up for obvious lack of skill with sheer hubris?"

"Empty words coming from someone who can't even touch my Schwartzritter."

"...I was just letting you butter yourself up."

A flash as the elbow-blades extend.

"You're just pointing and shooting, girl. A real ace figures out how to surpass themselves in every fight!!"

The Oxtongue Rifle fires again, but in a blur, the target is gone.

"How-?"

The first slash bisects the rifle's barrel, the next, two of the wings. A flurry of cuts surrounds the Black Knight like a cage, and its all she can do to keep from being torn to shreds.

"This is the power of a real pilot! MAI SUZAKU!!!"

The final cut scores straight down the length of the Schwartzritters front, taking off half the head, two fingers, a big chunk of waist armor, and almost severing the left leg at the knee. Falling from unreactive fingers, the remains of the rifle fall into the ocean.

The black mechs gauntlets unfold, and the useless fingers are replaced by large glowing claws.

Brooklyn barely ducks under Shine's blade, which takes a sizable length of the Vysaga's cape off. The R-Blade flips over his head to avoid his low slash, and he barely turns in time to catch the riposte.

"You cannot hope to face me, Shadow Mirror! My destiny is written in the stars! Your only future is surrendering to me, all other paths lead to oblivion!"

"Quite a dramatic young girl, aren't you?" The Vysaga flies back, parrying incessant blows as it retreats. "But I'm afraid its a warriors duty to face oblivion head-on!"

"So be it!!" A three slice combo leaves a gash on the Vysaga's arm, which bleeds red energy.

"Well, since I'm destined to die here, I should at least make it a good death. Limiter, deactivate!"

"L-limiter..??"

"Kojinsen!"

Surging with invisible energy, the Vysaga blurs forward, the only detail visible being the flash of its blade. In the space of 10 seconds, nearly 30 blows fly at the R-Blade, before a final stab flies at the cockpit.

With a flourish, Shine deflects the last blow using both Tonfas. The blades are chipped, there are gashes on her shoulders and legs, and the pneumatics on her left arm are leaking from the strain, but the R-Blade is still intact.

"Fool! I know exactly where your blade is going to fall. Swing it a thousand times, I'll catch every one!"

"Impressive. But, you focused a little too much on my blade, I think. Considering what my other hand was doing." The Vysaga holds up its left hand, revealing a section of cable.

"Wh-what's that?"

"It was connecting that ugly backpack module to your main reactor. I hope it wasn't important..."

The R-Blades Tesla drive loses the last of its power and shuts down, sending Shine spiralling down into the sea, howling in rage and grief.

Have people just forgotten about what just happened to Lamia? Or do they not give a shit?

Zeonquestfag from /tg/ here. Just read through your archived shit. Damn good show, Sciencebolt.

Now, sounds like a good time for Brooklyn to go rescue Lamia, presuming she isn't already dead, that is.

More like we just don't have the resources to rescue her until the aces are taken out. Let's have Bullet help her now, then rush to pick up Shine so we can capture her and not have to fight her again.

SUDDEN VIEWPOINT SHIFT

Irm throttles up his Gespensts reactor and hits the water at full boost, the Tesla drive and the boosters sending him skating along the ocean towards the battle. Dumi and Russel are right behind him, with Echidna and Ibis further back as they need to devote more thrust to avoid sinking. Arado flies overhead.

You see the situation: Axel is engaging some fast black mech, which seems to be matching him blow for blow given how wrecked both of them look. Two more enemy units, reminiscent of the R-Blade, are attacking the other Trilobite, with the Vysaga heading to intercept them. And you can just barely see the legs of the Angelg and another R-Blade sinking into the depths.

WHO GOES WHERE? Your Trilobite is a little further back, but still might be able to support.

Dumi grabs Angelg. It's probably the only one big enough to support it. I guess Russel or Irm can grab the R-Blade and disable it, another one is always nice. The others support the other Trilobite.

Oh, shit. Yeah, forgot about her.

Anyway, send a DGG to recover the Angelg, though Katina would probably be happier killing things. Irm takes the R-Blade back. Echidna and Ibis cover the Trilobite, Arado and Russel assist Axel.

Katina is busy procuring safehouses. Dumi will be assigned to recovery by default should this plan be followed.

If the water is not deep enough to damage the R-Blade or the Angelg, then let's leave them there for the Trillobite to rescue.

Then send Dumi to support Bullet and send Russel and Irm to help Axel out.


If the depth is high enough to damage the mechs or make it impossible to salvage them, then send Dumi to retrieve the Angelg and Russel to try to keep the R-Blade from sinking until the trillobite comes to save both.

Send Irm to help Axel. Bullet can probably handle the enemies by himself.

Uh, we should probably have Irm help Bullet. Axel would probably vapourize us if we meddled in his MANLY DUEL.

No, we want to capture Shine so we can get some info out of her. She's crazy and unstable, so if we interrogate her right she'll probably spill everything out of conviction we can't do anything about it. Plus it's not really hard to restrain a 13 year old girl.

Yeah, I'd say we'd be safer with her dead. She's just too much of a risk otherwise.

She's precognitive, not telekinetic.

As such, spending any amount of time around Katina would probably drive her irreparably and hilariously insane.

We capture her and lock her in a room with Katina. Might be a violation of the Geneva Convention, but who cares?

Correction: her mech can block every attack from the Vysaga. She should be easy to catch.

Pretty much. Shine can see the future great in her mech. Take her out of it and she should be pretty easy to run down and restrain with handcuff/straitjacket/whatever. She doesn't have super human strength or telekinetic abilities. The worst thing to happen would be her stealing a mech, which we can limit by some decent security measures like not letting people randomly launch their mechs.

We have Katina. That should be enough to keep Shine from stealing one of our mechs. Shine just has too see what Katina would do to her in the future if she ran away.

Yes, and that's the point. Katina is so fucking all over the place that any attempt read the future as far as Katina is concerned could possibly break Shine's brain.
