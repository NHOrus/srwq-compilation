Last thread seems to have dropped off page 10 overnight, but no big loss.

Where last we left our brave adventurers, they had been given a quest by the rebel leader Van Vat Tran, to retrieve the missing scientist Sophia Nate from the dark dungeons of the Earth Cradle, before the fiendish forces of the EFA get to her first.

Our chosen warriors and their mighty steeds are:

Katina Tarask, the team's Crazy Person, in the WildRaubtier.
Masaki and Ryuune, heroes from another world, in Cybuster and Valsione
Shuu Shirakawa, self-declared Scientific Saviour of Earth, in the Invincible Earth Liberation Warrior Granzon
Latooni Subota, School Graduate, Ice Queen and secretly in love with danger, in the Soldifar.
Dumi, the Dynamic Unlimited Mitilary Intelligence, a very helpful AI, in the transforming super-motorbike DGG04
Ibis Douglas, gun nut and artillery specialist, in a Schutzwald.

Mounted on the mighty sky-vessel Trilobite, our heroes soar over the lost continent of Africa towards a most fateful encounter...

"Katina, do you see anything out there?" Ibis asked from the cockpit of the Schutzwald.

You turn away from the window and look over at her. "Nothing, couple of Lion-Vs escorting the shuttle. If they have any new models to go with their alien tech, they're still stowed away."

"Fair enough. I guess the Barrellions aren't for long-distance flight..."

"You a fan of the Barrellion?"

"My friend Filio helped design them, and I helped to test-pilot them along with Sleigh. I actually had a pretty good custom version by the end of the first war, but then Sliegh dissappeared, and I abandoned it when I went looking for her..."

"Maybe we should ask Vat Tran if he has any spare, trade the Schutzwald for one."

"Do you really think that's a fair trade?"

"...Probably not."

The command crew call over the speakers. "Ten minutes to target zone. Be prepared for nighttime combat."

WHAT WILL KATINA DO FOR THOSE TEN MINUTES?

I say for the actual battle to use this:

Katina and Masaki as scouts. When the enemies are spotted, Katina gets away in order to support from the rear along with Ibis & Lat. Masaki, Ryuune and Shuu split to different areas so that they can have more space to use their map attacks. Sent Dumi to the boss mech that is bound to appear.

Yes, cold metal knife is ready to go, if you need it. You could have asked for a spare Guarlion Assault Blade, but it wouldn't stow properly in FM mode.

Can someone tell me why the Beam Cannon and Hyper Beam Rifle are treated as seperate weapons in OG1, when they're obviously intended to be the same gun in the lineart?

Because the Hyper Beam Rifle changes it's layout in order to shoot more focused, long-raged beams that work better with the human-shape mode.

The Beam Cannon mode fires more spreadt shots that are made for flight mode use.

"Acknowledged. What's the terrain like?"

Ensign Vicky (who is not a w-series) pulls up the data the DC gave her. "It's hilly desert terrain, just the other side of the Sahara proper. You're looking for a half-melted black dome in a wide valley."

"Gotcha. And enemies."

"The passive sensors are picking up signatures that look like 2 EFA ships of a similar class to the ones we saw this morning. Also, we saw what looked like Reentry Capsules dropping in a hundred klicks to the north, so they will have backup coming."

"Right. Guys, you think we need any special plan here?"

Ibis frowns on the comm window. "D-do we have the firepower to take on battleships?"

Dumi cuts in. I suspect Masaki, Ryuune, and Dr. Shirakawa may have the capability to threaten the ships. I may be able to assist them in this. The rest of the group can take on the PT complement. If we have problems, the larger units can lead the EFA away while Katina and Latooni take their smaller mechs into the Earth Cradle and find the target.

"Right!"

"Understood."

First out of the Trilobite are you and Masaki, the Cybuster surging ahead as if it were part of the wind itself. He's well away from you by the time the EFA forces notice you.

Dozens of Gespensts, Schutzwalds, and Raubtiers turn to face the oncoming threat, their fire bursting around Cybuster like a shower of sparks, but he weaves his way through it almost effortlessly. Then a few of them notice you.

Angelg and Valsione are close behind you, and you're facing 3 enemy raubtiers and 2 gespensts. WHAT DO YOU DO?

"Back me up Girls!!" You gun the afterburners and charge at the nearest enemy, who was sorta expecting you to dodge all the missiles he just fired. Instead, you boost through the swarm of ordinance and fire several pulses of the beam cannon. One blast shears off his wing as he attempts to avoid you nearly ramming him, and he transforms to PT mode to stabalise, only for a burst of beam shots from Latooni to strike him in midair.

Ryuune draws an ornate blade from...somewhere, and chases after another Raubtier which is firing on her. She jinks past the incoming fire and lands a hit, but its not fatal and the Raubtier turns and boosts away. Lamia soaks several missile hit but puts a plasma arrow right through the cockpit of the third, sending it to the ground in flames.

You're about to turn to assist Ryuune when a shell cracks against the side of the Raubtier. Minimal damage, but it reminds you there are 2..no, 4 Gespensts now, bearing down on your group. The rest seem to be distracted by Masaki.

The Gespensts send Slash Rippers after you but you dodge in a wide arc, as 3 DC Lion-Vs swoop in to assist.

The Granzon is ignoring the main fight, heading straight for the battleships, who have been too busy firing at Masaki. Latooni is in range with her large Bit Gun. Dumi is carrying Ibis into range.

With the Lions distracting the Gespensts, you take the time to gain some hieght, and swoop back down. "Latooni, suppression fire!"

"Alright." The shoulders of the Soldifar open up and unleash volleys of missiles, which fly into the EFA formation. Several Gespensts are hit, the others scattered, and you pounce. One pops like a bubble under a beam shot, the other takes a missile to the tesla drive and plummets to earth, dashing itself on the hills below. The other two are disabled by the Lions.

Suddenly, a storm erupts in the heart of the main EFA force, with Cybuster in the centre. His mech unleashes wave after wave of green-blue energy, washing over the EFA units and beating them back. A dozen are crushed by the force, another dozen disabled, and two of the battleships are pushed back by the force, nearly colliding.

"Masaki, I didn't know you could do that!"

"It's the Cybusters greatest trick, but it takes a lot out of the both of us. Could you guys come in and give me some backup, I'm low of juice here!"

Ryuune finally takes down her target and boosts in Masaki's direction. However, as she does so, she provokes a concentrated response from the Schutzwald squadron, who are on the ground and thus were sheltered from Masaki's attack.

Two DC Barrelions are flying in to support you. WHAT DO YOU DO?

In canon this is what happens. Remember when he first shows up in OG1.

Which suggests that when we meet up with the SRX it will be less game-breaking destroyer of worlds and more dangerously unstable mech that needs to be repaired after every transformation.

"Dumi! Do what you do best!"

Very well.

The massive shape of Dumi zooms in and puts itself between the Valsione and the Schutzwalds, soaking up a dozen beam blasts. With the distraction, your own forces open up, firings precision beams and railguns into the EFA lines, taking out several and forcing the others to ground.

"Don't waste ammo guy, I can handle this!" Ryuune flies down, almost to ground level, and begins to spin. The Valsiones shoulders emit pink streamers of energy, which tears up the ground and sends the surviving Schutzwalds into disarray. As the second energy storm comes to an end, the only remaining Schutzwald begins to retreat, but a green burst guts the cockpit.

"Woah! Look at that!" cries Ibis.

The white Guarlion-esque suit lowers its weapon and transforms, into a Raubtier-like flight mode. "This is Star 3 to all DC units, follow my lead. Shadow Mirrors, take the battleships." With that, the woman boosts off after Dumi, followed by her troops.

WHAT DO YOU DO?

Basically, we are the villains to them but we really aren't evil.

Then we show them the error of their ways by kicking their Genesic asses into oblivion, pulverizing their Z-alloy armour and making the Getter Rays look like a bitch. With the help of other powerful mechas of course. Ones with less lawfully stupid heroes.

Exactly. And the "heroes" of other universes are too fucking hot-bloodly stupid to realize that there is more than just white and black moralities. That just because we all served an evil overlord doesn't mean that we all deserve to die and that we have no redeeming values.

(for the super robot pilots)

And the other goverments of those other several universes see us as a threat to be eliminated, and that our death will keep an accident like the dimension jumoing hijink from happening again. This plus the fact that the general public from other universes see us as monsters means that they can destroy us without issues. And the pilots just follow orders becuase, sincerely, they don't give a shit about our universe.

(for the real robot shows.)


Then it is our job to show them how a REAL HERO OF JUSTICE works like, along with the less stupid and understanding people from mecha shows.

This, of course, it's just an excuse to have a final boss that isn't just an extremely EVIL villain that gets defeated after everyone gathers the COURAGE and LOVE to defeat it in an epic final battle that we have seen in the series for more than 20 times.

I want something different. Let's have a heroes vs heroes final fight for once.

That idea, like I said, is what I would want to see in the final fight. And I know that different people have different tastes and therefore they will want different endings of sorts.

But I still think you should not be so narrow-minded. Try to think outside the box and think about other plot events besides everyone saving the planet from ultimate evil for the 20th time while having no conflicts with other main characters for once.

Hell, even the latest SRW tried to do that. If I remember correctly, the heroes fought between themselves constantly and alliances were broken because of the widely differing point of views all these characters from very different universes have.

And that just gives a deeper form of characterization. While I most definelty want everyone to die pointless deaths and have an evil overlord ending, I would still want to see a clash of beliefs.

Will the GGG crew who believes in never giving up and saving the world without killing anyone work with Lelouch who wants to free an oppresed land even though their methods are less than clean? Or will they work with Brittania who is currently trying to keep said land under their control at all costs?

What if the guys in said army won't just switch over to the "good" guys because they really think they are doing the right thing? What if they don't switch sides suddenly and become valuable allies of the GGGs? What if they are going to SAVE the world in their very own way but the GGG's values collide with theirs?

Chances are, Gai is plowing thru them anyway without haste, but at least seeing him interact with enemies that aren't clearly evil and won't switch sides or be reborn later would be interesting.

Manly tears are shed?

Gai has shown that he is a pure person that did something he did not want to do, but was forced to and will have to bear that burden forever.

What if he kills them without giving them a second thought?

He is not as heroic as we thought.

Haven't gotten around to playing Z yet, but I somehow have the feeling they pulled it off better than you. And even then what I've heard with the Spheres does annoy me for pointless GRIMDARK. But I'm willing to hold off until I get around to playing it.

Either way, what you're suggesting just comes off as being really, really stupid.

Sanger and Ratsel came to the DC to make a deal and treated them as equals. The only people we the players know they think of as evil by now is Beowulf, and well...they're right. By pretty much every metric THEY'RE the heroes, not us. We're playing the psychotic torturer who acts on pure impulse and willingly joined the group wanting to create a world of eternal war. We the players are still fighting over if we want to become a true hero or a true villain and in the meantime Katina has constant mood swings where sometimes she's decent and sometimes she nearly smothers a little girl.

Personally I disagree. I love seeing Katina's antics, be they psycho or dere. The problems really tend to arise with the character whenever we make her go either too psycho or too dere, with not enough of the other to balance her out. When she ends up too psycho she's likely to get herself and the entire cast killed stupidly, but when she goes too dere we basically end up with Excellen Mk II.

Mostly they just seem to think Katina's crazy, if we can constantly show Masaki, Lune, and Arado we're not and we really want to be good now then they can vouch for us and TEAM UP. SRW protagonists are the most forgiving people on the planet, if we truly want to go down the redeemed psychopath route then we could easily make them our allies. The only reason to keep fighting would be because we're not actually redeemed. We might not even need buddies to vouch for us if we make a good enough speech and back it up, see comic.

I'm planning to continue these threads until we either find an ending or write ourselves into a pointless area where there's no gain to continuing. I may be updating the threads less regularly, but there'll be content.

As for where the plot goes, it really is up to you. I have plot threads available to stay in the SMverse for ages, but if the plot goes certain ways, the Time Diver route is a perfectly good option. I don't know if I'd do so well going to OGverse though, I prefer having my own canvas to work on than adding to an existing one. Making up my own SRW continuities sounds better.

Just to point out: Not a Megaman fan. Haven't seen Code Geass. I'm familiar with a lot of /m/ stuff but haven't watched a lot of the more popular things. This will color my reinterpretations of things. Any Geass that shows up is likely to be limited to a few archetypical characters and basic plot threads.

You pull up, a shell grazing your hull. "Turrets are too well-armored...Lat!"

"It's the Cry Wolves, Katina. The EFA's special recovery team. They've come for Dr. Nate, and we're in their way."

So it WAS the Altairlion. I wonder who's the pilot?

Anyway, break off the attack on the Kestrels and assist "Star 3". Hit and run tactics may be the best option to go for against them, and the Raubtier should be fast enough to pull it off. Hopefully distract them long enough for some of the others to rescue Dr. Nate while they're busy with us.

Either way, move to assist Star 3.

As for the long-term discussion, I'm picking up Disgaea 1 vibes from the story more than anything else (all factions' motives being fairly noble but mismanaged by the assholes in power). The SCIENTIFIC SAVIOR OF EARTH! being on our side doesn't help.

"Ok, we'll go for Dumi's plan. Everyone cover me and Lat, we'll make a run for the Earth Cradle!"

"Roger!" The group rushes to support the DC, and streams of fire start to volley back and forth across the hills of Mali. Meanwhile, sticking close to the ground, you fly down the length of the valley, with Lat coming behind.

The valley is covered in the rusting hulks of Gespensts and Lions, marking the site of the last great battle of the Neo-DC/Inspector War. Up ahead looms the cracked dome which is the entrance to the Earth Cradle, once the DCs ultimate sanctuary, now a desolate ruin.

"If they're half as smart as they think they'll are, they'll have someone sent ahead to the Cradle...there!!" You dodge to the side as beam shots come from the sides of the valley. You can see a black Gespenst, clearly non-standard, blazing away at you, and coming far too close for comfort.

"Gespenst Custom, Halloween type. Definitely Cry-Wolves." Latooni doesn't even break stride, launching missiles and rapid-fire beam blasts back at the unit, which charges forward in a evasive pattern.

"Lat, keep him off my back!!" You open up the Afterburners and boost towards the dome, as Latooni counter-charges, drawing her beam saber as she approaches. She dives through a burst of split missiles and attempts a slash, but the Gespenst dodges backwards, and swings the butt of its oversized cannon around to knock her away.

A grizzled voice, male. "Nice try, but if you're going to get rid of me, you'll have to work for it." The Jet Magnum whizzes past the Soldifar's head, followed by two offhand punches and a kick, and then the Gespenst is boosting into the sky, the secondary barrel locking into place as he aims at the Raubtier.

"You're doing the work for me..." Latooni swings up the bit gun.

Both beams hit simulataneously. You howl at the WildRaubtiers right engine turns to scrap, and hurriedly transform and make a hard landing. You look back, and see the Gespenst land, a massive hole where the cockpit should be.

A hole which is already covering over with green rope-like tentacles.

The man who should be vaporised sounds like he wants to laugh. "Sorry, but that's not a very good resume. I'll require a fresh application."

Yeah, this is why I wanted to talking to Kai as to what exactly happened to him as a priority. Then we wandered off to level up other relationships. When (if) we get back we need to clear up his story as soon as possible, and ask everyone else if they know any more information about the upper echelons of the EFA and any nasties that might be in store. We call a big meeting with everyone we know and disseminate the info as much as we can.

This is the perfect thing to unite everyone against a common enemy, which both heightens survival and allows plenty of opportunities for hero and villain routes,. Because face it, there's just no reasoning with the Einst. It's like reasoning with the STMC.

Take a moment to assist Lat in fucking dismembering his mech, but only if there's none of his buddies coming in.

If he does have reinforcements coming, forget him, grab Lat, and head into the Earth Cradle. We can probably find a choke-point in there somewhere where the only option he has is to fly into our beam spam.

"What, you think because I soaked one hit that I like it? Gotta make you work for it, girls!"

You dive backwards as the missiles throw up the ground you were standing on. Latooni runs towards you, firing, but only scores minor hits.

"Dumi! We could really use a hand right about now!"

Actually, I think you may have assistance already.

"What? Where?"

The drill erupts out of the groun and kerrangs off the Gespenst, sending it crashing to earth. the hole it made erupts into a fountain of earth, as something massive tears itself from its rocky womb.

Ok guys, people may be wondering what actually happened with last nights thread. Well, the truth is, I was about to post the next bit of exposition when I was suddenly hit by a one-day ban, for having a 'banned url' in my posts. I have no idea what this might have been, since the only URL I posted was the easymodo links to the previous threads. But in future, I'll have to avoid posting anything like that, just in case.

I'm currently posting from work, but I don't know if I'll be able to support a full thread today, since once I'm done for the day its back to my banned IP.

Ok, to set the scene a bit better from thread 19 (which is still on easymodo): Katina and co. had just rescued Dr. Nate from the Earth Cradle, and had discovered that she and her companions Wodan Ymir and a girl called Cynthia had only survived its destruction by being exposed to Machine Cells, turning them into something other than human.
