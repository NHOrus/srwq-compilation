Right, so this isn't actually an official SRWQ thread, but I got Sciencegar's permission. This is for mech discussion, since the last thread is on autosage.

So, my goal is to come up with a unique mech for each of the School kids currently or with the potential to be in our party. That means Katina, Latooni, Arado, and Seolla. Latooni's already had hers designed, leaving us with three more to go.

Brainstorm thread, yay!

In addition to the mech designs, we should probably discuss how we're going to get them built too...

In any case.

KATINA: Basically RaiOh, but with more lightning. We've been going well with it so far, so...
ARADO: Jyaki-GUN-Oh. Can combine with the new RaiOh.
SEOLLA: Heavily armoured sniper type. Active camo, perhaps?

Katina: RaiOh Kai. Keeps the default weapons/attacks, but adds:
--Plasma Tonfas on each arm.
--Terminus Engine in the form of a belt; resembles Agito's belt.
--Vysaga's Folding Claws, if we have spares.
--Garmreid's Thunder Spin Edges.

Working on ideas for the other two.

Given Katina's fighting style it needs to be a super with high acceleration (talking such that te cockpit's shock absorbers will need shock absorbers). Melee focused obviously but it could do with one ranged weapon as backup. Given how many times we had the enemy fleeing underwater (FUCKING SHINE) and the Raioh's weapons became fairly useless we need a decent backup weapon that works in water terrain (maybe an oversized combat knife or something).

I'm thinking maybe retractable Vysaga type claws on both the wrists and ankles which can be charged up with plasma like for Raioh's lightning fall. Also we made good use of the Plasma Leaders in interesting ways so something of that nature would be good. Flight capability is a must obviously but I figure that's a given.

The current Terminus Engine you have consists of Einst organs, shoved into a set of Earth-made energy convertors. It works the same way, and its got the same output, but its a bit...ickier.

The Vysagas claws have become the Rapiecages' Magnum Beaks, sorry.

Let's start with what we've already got, Latooni's custom:

The result of altering an Ashsaber with Machine Cells, the Balder is a machine customized for SM!Latooni's personal use. Taking elements from her preferred combat types, the unit is versatile, armed with a "Viscumalbum" adjustable-range beam rifle which is stored on the back, sliding under the right shoulder when in use. In addition to this, for close and mid-range combat, the unit carries a pair of "Matricaria" sword rifles at its hips, mutated versions of the Ashsaber's Gun Rapier. Normally closed in sword form, the handle swings 45 degrees and the blade splits down the center to reveal the rifle emitter, with the top portion sliding backwards over the hand for bracing and the bottom portion shifting downward to form the handguard. The Sword Breakers have evolved into "Draupnir" remote weapons, possessing greater firepower and the ability to use the unit's own Hyper Jammer so that they appear to duplicate themselves to even greater numbers. Finally, a transformation mode has been added similar to the StealthRaubtier's, providing higher acceleration and dodging capability at the cost of losing access to the Draupnirs, which cannot be deployed as they cannot keep up with the unit's speed.

The overall look of the unit is organic, like all Machine Cell creations. The Draupnirs are docked on the unit's back, unlike the Ashsaber's original shoulder-mounted arrangement, forming part of the wings in bird mode. While transformed, it bears great similarity to a large bird of prey, and can even be ridden by Tis's Belgermir for part of a "Twelve Judgements" combination attack.

Flight capability could be gained from a prehensile scarf. Getter scarf wings, anybody? And a flexible, shapechanging scarf could do all sorts of crazy shit (SPACE LARIAT, or a boomerang)

I don't get why people say Katinas a melee pilot. She's an ASSAULT pilot, theres a difference. She advances while attacking, but she can use ranged weapons to do this just fine (For example, shotguns). She's been getting good use out of the Harken Impulses on the Raioh, its just that they're not its ultimate weapon.

But then I'm biased because I put her in the R-Gun for OG1, and she did beautifully there.

Anyway I like the idea of wrist and ankle claws. Maybe build in forearm and hip mounts for ranged weapons, could build shotgun type weapons onto the forearms and beam weaponary into the hips (or indeed any random combination people like with each mount having a different weapon type).

I have an idea for Katina's machine. It'd be called the Algol. Considering Katina's old habit of liking to cut things, I thought that would be a nice theme for it.

The machine's about as big as the Raioh, and similarly painted red. However it has a much more slight frame and no bulky legs or a scarf. Its primary weapon is a large retractable blade that extends from the top of its wrist and has about half the length of the machine. It can run a current through itself to electrify it.

In addition, there are two emergency and apropriately-proportioned shotguns stored inside its underarms that are springloaded to come out in the event its primary blade can't do the job. Inside of its legs are a pair of barbed chains, with the launchers located on the bottom of the feet. These can be used for long-range attacks or alternatively for grappling and inescapable Rider Kicks. Like the primary blade, an electrical current can be run through this as well. A third chain could be included in the left arm.

Through the application of electromagnetism, the chains can go in a wide variety of angles, changing directions numerous times before striking the target. The chains can also be broken or reformed whenever the need arises due to special magnetic properties within them.

It's primarly a close-range machine, yes. I'm also open to anyone suggesting revisions to it.

Seolla fairly obviously needs a ranged mech with at most a beam saber or something for melee which would likely never get used. Given her unique circumstances a swift evasive real type is definitely the order of the day. Definitely some form of energy shield to keep stuff away from her.

Pilot interface could maybe have a helmet that can have scopes that move to cover either or both of her eyes depending on the situation. These could provide targetting data and whatever other things would be useful for sniping and stuff.

Weapon-wise I can't really think of anything different to the Weissritter and Wildfalken's main weapon.

Considering how many things Katina's tried to violate so far I presume that the laws of physics are on her list sooner or later.

So! To recap what we're planning on puttnig on the Algol:

1. Sword attached to the top of the right wrist
2. Shotguns stored in each arm
3. Special magnetic chains in the legs and left arm
4. A scarf (possibly Raioh's), that is able to be reshaped through electrical currents to form wings, drills, etc.
5. Eye lasers

Its appearance would be red along with the red scarf, though it would look more feminine than the Raioh and less bulky. Sound good?

You have a theme in mind? Let's hear it.

>>4662606
I was considering this, actually - next to Latooni's complete mech, I'm probably closest to finishing the ShrikeRider. It's a hand-to-hand-oriented real-type that uses a Direct Motion Link system. In terms of general performance, it's the rough equivalent of V2 Assault - blisteringly fast, blisteringly strong offensively, not a lot of armor but doesn't honestly need it. Energy-enhanced kicks and punches that funnel Arado's rage into stronger attacks. Armaments include a set of Shining Calibers mounted on the waist and eye lasers. Further, it rides a support platform similar to a mix between a shrike and a stag beetle, including a Rider Crusher much larger than the Wildwuerger's Stag Beetle Crusher on the front end.

Some of this needs work, but what do you guys think?

Well, the theme I had in mind was possibly something due to the "sibling" idea that Arado mentioned and Katina's usage of electricity.

In the Ba Gua elemental system (Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Moon, Heavens, Mountain, Lightning), Lightning is considered the "eldest brother" element. Katina's messed up in the head and also the oldest, so even though she doesn't have a penis (or does she?) she counts for that.

In the event we somehow win over Ouka, she, as the eldest "sister" gets some sort of wind themed machine.

Seolla and Arado are like "middle children", so Seolla gets a Fire themed machine (the element of the "middle daughter") while Arado gets a Water themed machine (the element of the "middle son").

Lat, as the youngest daughter (youngest girl in the School we know is alive) gets a Moon themed machine.

... Yeah... >_> Not sure how much of this should be taken or not but hey, it's at least a start.

When it comes to Katina and her future ranged weapons I think body/waist/shoulder mounted would likely be best. Allows for firing without holding out limbs and some of them can be fired while we're engaged in close quarters combat. Also if Katina was piloting one before she joined SM then they must not be TOO hard to come by.

For Arado I vote we develop a Tek-Setter, or failing that give him an Earthgain series mech. They have motion controls, fight with their fists, and have nice durability.

Lat is now the pilot of the rape cage right? Does it have the Geim system installed? If so then FUCK, she must always be deployed near Dumi like the Raioh.

Seolla....wanna make her the weissy that Lemon was developing before OG2? The Weissritter Abend from Endless frontier was created from diagrams on a Shadow Mirror vessel that seems to have been Lemon's personal development workshop. It's basicly a weisritter armed with a rifle that functions similarly to the Rein Weissy's rifle.

Okay had a concept for Seolla's based off the discussion in this thread. Not sure of a name yet because I'm useless at that.

Pilot wears a helmet like mentioned in >>4662736. The main unit itself is only a torso and head with a couple of shoulder mounted twin linked cannons. This can transform into a flight mode which can still use the cannons but would mostly be used for relocating around the battle field.

The rest of the unit is stored on a large weapon platform that's pilotted by an autopilot (or could just hang out in our ship's hanger if she's staying close to the ship. This has at least ten iterations of each limb which work on a basic Funnel type system, they can't be used for fighting when moving around independently, but they can move to the main unit swiftly, dock easily and dodge any fire intended to stop them from reaching Seolla. Each of the limbs could be mounted with different loadouts suitable for every type of ranged combat from sniping, to artillery to dog fighting. This way if the unit gets damaged she can swap out for fresh parts and keep going. The platform itself also mounts heavy missiles which Seolla could call targets for with some sort of laser designator or something.

Both the main unit and the weapon platform would have a strong defensive energy shield and the same stealth coating as you find on the Stealthraubtier, etc. Should the weapon platform be destroyed or damaged, any surviving limbs are programmed to return to a preset homepoint (the ship probably) but can still be called over to the unit as needed.

There, this idea probably needs some work, but what do you guys think?

Thing is is that the Huckey's core fighter is a lot smaller than the Einsamkeit's will be, considering the Einsamkeit's makes up the entire torso, while the Huckey's just kind of slots into the top of the body. Right now the head's just about in proportion with the limbs. I feel if I made it any bigger, I'd have to make the limbs bigger too, but then the torso would end up looking really small...
Unless we go with the core fighter transforming into a core block mode, I suppose. But then I'd basically have to redesign the whole torso.

Bored Couch, class, etc.

Customized for SM!Katina after the need to abandon RaiOh became evident, Algol was built to be a more ideal machine for her particular talents. A towering super robot standing over 50 meters in height, Algol is significantly more feminine in body structure than its predecessor, though it retains the bulky proportions of a super robot. In terms of offensive capabilities, Algol is a beast - its palms feature force manipulators that allow it to grab, repel, and draw enemies closer, or deliver crushing blows to a physically grabbed enemy. This also lends immense power to Algol's punches, more than its frame would suggest. The top of each knee is mounted with a blade jutting diagonally upward, allowing it to draw an enemy close and attack in one fluid motion. The large, flared armor on the side of each lower leg doubles as a compartment, each containing a super robot-sized shotgun, while each hip and shoulder sports a larger force manipulator designed with propulsion in mind, giving it unexpected agility. The scarf around its neck can be pulled off, at which point it morphs into a long, slender blade roughly the length of a fully expanded Zankantou, though lacking the blade width in exchange for higher fine control. As a product of Machine Cells, Algol's regenerative capability is enormous. Possessing incredible strength, speed, and durability, it truly is Katina's ideal mech.

The Striker Pack concept is for a generalist pilot, who needs to be flexible and fight in a number of different ways. Katina and Latooni are generalists, Arado and Seolla are specialists.

It's more that I don't see the advantanges of them over another sniper rifle. The idea as I understood it was that it would allow Seolla to equip different weapons quickly, but she doesn't use different weapons. For Latooni, the Balders mix of transformable sword-guns, bits and flight mode because she fights with strategy, not weapons. Seolla doesn't fight like that: She sees a target and tries to make it go away. She doesn't want to become invested in a single opponent, she wants quick, clean and efficient kills. It's not that bits are worse at this than a rifle, its that they're not better, and she's used to rifles.

I sort of agree with you, I came up with this concept cause it seemed to be what people wanted at the time.

Like this if a heavy target came up she could bring in some thigh mounted missile launchers, if someone was pursuing her then she could bring in arms carrying ranged weaponary for a dogfight, etc.

Not yet...let's take a cue from the R-Blade Custom and add either a set of over-the-shoulder cannons or some eye lasers.

Also, while I'm still pretty attached to the idea of the utility that comes with being able to pull and push enemies remotely, in terms of its being an improvement over Raioh, an alternative might be tonfa attached to the forearms which can launch out on chains, providing a similar effect and giving us the Chaos Blades people want.

What if we make a dancing mech?

This mech would have an incredibly elastic and durable frame AND bones + a cockpit similar to the Dygenguar's that would allow it to mimic the dancer-pilot's movements precissely.

But how can dancing be helpfull in a combat situation? Simple: we build incredibly powerfull frequencies capable of hijacking enemy mechs' controls while also increasing their energy output to the max, allowing them to move in ways that wouldn't normaly be possible because of their bodies.

And then we forcefully make them copy the Dancer's moves. Considering most mech's are not build with dancing and elasticity in mind, this dancing would make their frames and skeletons turn into fine paste, damageing built in weapons and possibly dissabling their arms, making it impossible for them to grab weapons.

Actually, one thing about the dancing mech I'd be worried about is this - if we're going with the controlling other mechs ability, that means that in any given fight either it's going to be completely fucking broken, which will lead to the kind of escalation that got us in our current mess, or it's going to be completely useless because anyone we would want to use it on will be immune to it. I'm not sure we really want the hassle, cool as it may sound.

Back to Einsamkeit, I'm considering two possibilities. The first is basically Rein StealthFalken, a StealthFalken with upgraded capabilities thanks to Machine Cells. The other is similar to the above, but docked inside a large weapons platform a la Dendrobium or Meteor. Massive-range (and I'm talking surface-to-orbit) sniper rifle, artillery for mid-range, immense G Territory for keeping things out and away from her. Maybe have the platform be a separate craft which is co-piloted by Ibis and Russel. (After their scene in the Kurogane, SM!IbisxSM!Russel is my new OTP.)

And maybe we could give the God of Dancing a kinetic energy generator of sorts. So that means that it would get all of it's energy out of it's dancing, so it won't run out of energy mid-dance. Also, in those strange cases it runs out of energy, we could have it get the kinetic energy out of his allies' movements.

But then there is the energy-overload issue, but we could sort this out by releasing all this accumulated energy in the shape of an incredibly powerfull beam. It can even become more powerfull than the HTB cannon itself if enough energy is absorbed.

ALGOL WEAPONRY (preliminary listing?)
0.Plasma Invoker (Enables parts of the body to become charged with thunderous power)
1.Plasma Leaders
2.Progressive Claws, mounted on the fingertips
3.Scarf (Most used modes: Sword, whip, boomerang, wings. Can also be used as extra limbs, possibly to parry attacks?)
4.Eye Lasers
5.Twin 'shotguns'
6.Blades of Chaos (Normally mounted on the arms Soulgain-style, each 'blade' is actually six individual shortswords hardmounted together. They can be seperated and wielded via the Plasma Leaders or Electromagnetic Chains)
7.Electromagnetic Chains (Can be controlled, split up and reattached via electromagnetisism. Five lengths in total, mounted inside the arms, legs and on the back.)
8.Force Gauntlets/Greaves (Enhances the power behind punches kicks by an order of magnitude, and allows actions along the lines of a Force Push/Pull)
9.Rocket Punch (Actually closer to the Asteliavis' rocket punch, using the Chains to control the detached fist.)

Agreed. There's awesome, there's utility, and there's paralyzing numbers of options.

My suggestions:

-Eye lasers, a basic ranged attack in the event one's really needed.
-Force Palms, capable of executing Force Pull/Force Push as well as remotely grabbing opponents. In short, all the tricks we've normally used Raioh's Plasma Leaders for. I'm considering whether they should be usable for concussive blasts to provide a stronger ranged weapon than the eye lasers, but I'm on the fence about this.
-Twin shotguns, stored in the leg armor when not in use. More like flak cannons than shotguns, save for aesthetics.
-Blades of Chaos, two blades attached to the forearms on rotating joints near the wrists. While at first it appears as if they're just giant Blade Tonfa, both blades can be launched out on chains and used like their namesakes. This makes them an ideal utility weapon, capable of grabbing and hooking opponents as well as dealing powerful rending damage.

Look, I'm not saying we should drop the force palms...I'm just saying that maybe we're better served by including both systems...Or all three if you count the chains as seperate. Furthermore, if we can learn how to control multiple streams of lightning at once (the Plasma Leaders do show the ability to split up from a single stream) we can do shit like control multiple Blades of Chaos at once.

Also, for the chains to grab something, they have to wrap around first. Grabby lightning is just sorta sticky.

Personally, though, I think the chains might be best served as a means of propulsion, Spiderman-style. or something. Pulling on chains to move quickly around mid-air...Possibly a chain-guided Rider Kick...And the chainguided Rocket Punch (and possibly Rocket Kick too?).

Are you aware of what BoCs -are-? They're blades on chains. That's it, that's what they are - a pair of matched blades about the size of short sword, attached to extendable chains from the wielder's arms. Look up God of War on Youtube - that's how you fight with them. They're brutal, aggressive weapons that have -tremendous- utility and are, in short, perfect for Katina. Arguably we don't even need the force palms with those, it serves a -very- similar purpose.

If we keep the lightning and we keep the Plasma Leaders and all we're doing is just throwing more crap on there, it's basically just a Raioh rehash. I want to do something different.

Except that lightning has been pretty much made into Katina's element at this point. It's not just because of the Raioh, it's been worked rather significantly into her imagery by this point. As much as having something different from the Raioh is a good idea, giving up the lightning would be bad.

The original plan for SRWQ came about when I made a thread about a /tg/ campaign I was planning to run IRL, discussing possible scenarios I could try. I had a couple of ideas, like the PCs being another EFA team, or a DC squadron, or the far-out one when they were residents of the Earth Cradle tossed out by the Machinery Children and forced to Vault Dweller their way through a Alpha Gaiden or Z type of setting. But the most popular suggestion was the one where the PCs were Shadow Mirrors trying to survive in OGverse until Lemon and Vindel show up and start OG2s plot, and several posters asked if I would run it here rather than IRL. Being a reader of Zeonquest, and seeing that /m/quest seemed to be working, I gave it a shot. About halfway through the first thread, I realised that I was having more fun making up SM versions of the OG cast than with the original idea, so I decided to put the final desicion on whether to stay in SMverse or go to fuck up OGverse to the audience. They couldn't decide. So I was forced to compromise by bringing the OG cast to the SMverse.

I never did get around to running that IRL game...

Plus, if the gun's going on the shoulder, that's -way- too small for a sniper rifle. Look at Throne Eins for a good inspiration in that regard.

Not up to my usual standards due to it being late, but here's a sketchup statblock on the Einsamkeit. Critiques/suggestions welcome.

Einsamkeit: A Machine Cell PT developed by Dr. Andrews and Ring Mao with data from the Huckebein line and StealthFalken, the Einsamkeit was designed for long-range warfare, featuring a "Placidus Rifle" sniper rifle similar in size and design to the StealthFalken's Oxtongue Rifle, though in terms of actual functionality it more greatly resembles a version of the Huckebein Mark II's G-Impact Cannon customized for long-range fire. For mid-range attack, the unit mounts an array of micromissile packs on the outside of each lower leg, packing much more power and spread than the traditional Split Missiles. The right arm mounts a somewhat bulky array similar in shape to a large disc with a large fin extending back towards the elbow and a smaller one pointing forward. This is a dedicated gravicon and emitter of a large G-Territory, over twice the strength normally found on a PT. The Einsamkeit's support unit, on the other hand, was build by Harold Cooplowski. Taking every aspect of the Einsamkeit's initial design to the extreme, the craft is over eight times the size of the Einsamkeit itself, as large as most super robots. The unit packs a behemoth sniper rifle, a scaled-up version of the one the Einsamkeit base unit mounts, along with a large array of missile bays and beam cannons for mid-range assault. Opposite the cannon is mounted an immense G-Territory, far stronger than the one on the Einsamkeit itself, which makes the unit practically inapproachable while active. Unlike the Einsamkeit's personal Territory, however, the one on the larger craft can only be selectively activated due to energy requirements.

Scannerless drawfag here, I upgraded your Einsamkeit.

A few notes - there are additional sensors for the rifle in the head and on the back of the left arm to help form a 3D image of the target and area (when the left arm is supporting the rifle these sensors will be facing straight ahead). In addition to the micromissile packs on the outside of the leg, there are chaff grenades stored in each knee armour so that the Einsamkeit has at least a distraction weapon in close combat. While the armour has been downgraded from the Falken, the machine-cells give it some durability, and the large maneovering thrusters on the shoulders increase the agility significantly.

Man, computers really don't do soft pencils justice. Additionally, I'd like to mention that the shoulder guns fold back into the backpack, with the fuel tank inbetween them. It also has glasses and sensors hanging down on the left side of the head, just to make it a little more 'Seolla'. I also made the feet bigger and the height of the ankle joint more adjustable for greater stability whilst sniping.

And we already established Shota!Helios is actually Lalia.

If my memory serves, Sciencegar stated that SM!School dealt with older 'pupils' than the OGverse's.

So Katina could still be about the same age.

I think Science might have stated that the School took much older subjects in this world because it was more prominent and involved in the SRX project, though that might have just been someone's speculation.

More to the point, SM!Kusuha, unless she's some sort of prodigy, has to be in her mid 20s, since she's a doctor, which means she's gone through med school.

Yes, but given she was in the same group as Arado, not to mention her general behavior and personality, I'd say she's almost certainly younger than 25

SM Kusuha seems to be nurse not a doctor, so I guess she should be in early to mid 20...

Right. At any rate, still older than OG Kusuha by a good several years.

And Bullet would appear to be older as well, for that matter.

Sciencegar has pretty much stated outright that the SM characters are the same age as their OG counterparts.

Peoples ages are, except where I explicitly meant to change them, a few months older than the version from the OG games, to match up with the timeline in the SMverse (The Shadow Mirrors jumped well after the Inspectors war, a period I'm guesstimating to be 6 months to a year). So the people who were 18 in OG1 would correspond to 19-20 in the SMverse timeline.

After some discussion with Couch, I've rationalised the massive discrepancies in the School as the result of a conjoining of classes for the final test. Katina's final class consisted of the survivors of Bronzo, Latooni, and Gab classes, among others, with a student from the Aurum class assigned to them as a sort of class president.

What exactly happened to the rest of Gab class is unclear: Katinas memory between the burning of Mr Flopsy and the Final Class are a blur.

Nows probably not a good time to mention I'm not a huge fan of the Wildfalken, is it?

I like Stealthyboys entry, but not as what's meant to be a machine-cell mech. They're both fine as standard earth-tech mechs, but I'd prefer a little more stylisation for the pseudo-organic style of MC mechs.

Make the head a little more Bergelmir-y for starters (The head is the one part of the the Bergelmir I like, the gangly limbs not so much).

I'm actually not sure how much I could change the head on my design... I kinda based it on the Bergelmir's head to begin with...

I'm worried if I modify it more, it'll end up as just a carbon copy of a Bergy's head...

It does seem closer to the Falken's head then Bergelmir's. You could make it skinnier and sharper overall to get a closer parallel. Half of the Bergelmir's head seems to be extra crests and horns anyway, so if you stick with the V-fin as opposed to them, you could avoid it looking too similar.

Really? It looks like it has some variation of one. Maybe it's just the front-on perspective. Are those horns coming out the upper sides of the head instead?

That was supposed to be basically a strengthening jut going back to the head...

Okay, I've modified the design somewhat, basing it more on the Bergelmir than before...
It's basically finished, since I'm assuming the limbs will be symmetrical...
