## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 17: Spreading Justice by kicking things with fire

The needles are on your brain, pumping in the fire. The simulator... No, it's real youregonnadie the mech is spinning through the curtains of bullet, and Old Man Adler is screaming you, stop being a failure, why are all of you failures, and you have no choice but to shoot at the target, and you paint Her face on each of them but you can still here the babies screaming... or is it you?


"Any ideas, guys?"

You blink and you're back in the meeting room, in the middle of Africa. Irm's brow is furrowed as he looks over the group. Behind him, Aguija, the last Inspector, grins dismissively at all of you, while Van Vat Tran sit silently, taking it all in.

"We need to get her cooperation, but she's not just going to give it. We'll have to come up with a better deal, one that'll get us the technology but keep us in the DCs good books. Kai?"

Kai just blinks at him. "I thought you were supposed to stop trusting me and following all my advice."

"You choose now to be unhelpful."

"I want to see if you kids can handle this without me."


---

Ok, dramatis personae:

In the room are:
+ You, Katina Tarask, School dropout and crazy person
+ Irm, your pseudo-leader
+ Kai, Eye-patched free agent who helps out your group but seems to have his own agenda.
+ Ryuune Zoldark, from the OGverse. Representing the needs of the Irregulars, who need to find the Zweizergain to save their universe.
+ Echidna Iasaki, leader of the W-series, silent for now.
+ Latooni Subota, team data analyst and ice-queen.

Back on the ships:

+ OG Arado, Seolla and Masaki: Met up with you by various methods.
+ Shuu Shirakawa: Mysterious scientist who claims he will save the earth, from something, eventually.
+ Ring Mao: Former industrialist and test pilot, ally of Shuu.
+ Lenonjayce Starlord: Tired of ferrying Ring and Shuu around.
+ Ibis Douglas: Joined Shadow Mirror to find her friend Sleigh. Gun Nut and Artillery specialist.
+ Lamia Loveless: One of the W-series, has recently vowed to become a real person and fight for herself and her friends. Has stolen all of Axels clothes.
+ Axel Almer: Ranking leader of the Shadow Mirror, in the absence of Vindel and Lemon. In a coma after fighting his way across the US and the Gulf of Mexico, causing Soulgain to absorb too much of his lifeforce.
+ Brooklyn: A Chivalrous warrior.
+ Kusuha: A nurse with a penchant for alcohol.
+ Johnathan: Irm's father, designing the Neo Grungust.
+ Rio: Engineer, skilled at multitasking.
+ Ryoto: Engineer, skilled at saying how awesome Shadow Mirror is.
+ Shine: A captive enemy pilot, recovering from an impromptu interrogation session given by Katina.
+ Russel: Token irishman.
+ The Pods: They are not talking to you. Totally not talking to you.
+ Dumi: The AI support for the Raioh, is really helpful and friendly. Maybe too much so...

"So, you're a scientist, a handler of technology, Aguija?"

"I'm the closest thing this mudball has."

"So if there were technologies you didn't have, that we could give you access to, would you be interested in that in exchange for the dimensional thingie?"

"I highly doubt there's anything of merit left on your planet that Wendolo didn't already pilfer."

"Well, there are two things I can think of. Firstly, the Irregulars have all of their other-dimension technology, if you were to come with us you could get access to that. Or, if you want something now, we has samples for you."

"Samples?"

"The perfect pilots, with all the piloting skill of a human but totally obedient. You could make use of that, right?"

Echidna turns to you. "Lt. Tarask, you don't have any authority to make that kind of offer."

Ryuune also speaks out. "And you can't offer them our technology just like that, either!"

"Come on Irm, this is the best chance we have! We can't pass this up over a few weak objections."

Irm furrows his brow, looking over at the other two women. "Well... we have to do something... but I don't know about handing people over to her, that doesn't seem right, even if they have been altered."

"Then tell Ryuune to stop being stubborn! Her forces got us into this mess, she owes us!"

Ryuune shakes her head. "It's not about being tight-fisted with technology, it's about her. We fought her and her team in our world too, and they used every scrap of technology they could get to wage war on us. We can't trust her with the kind of secrets we have, she'll turn them on us!"

Vat Tran stands up at this. "I assure you, Ms Zoldark, if the alien does any 'turning' it'll be at my command and mine only. Her life is subborned to the Neo DC, and what technology she makes, is ours."

Aquija mutters something that her translator fails to translate. Vat Tran ignores her.

Ryuune looks thoughtful for a moment. "I... I'll have to talk it over with the others."

LAY WASTE TO THE EARTH

*ahem* Anyway, I agree with the idea of offering a non-Number W-Series. Tell the others that it's nothing unique, and that if we can get Aguija on our side by giving her tech, it might as well still be ours. Plus, as was mentioned, the Irregulars -are- going to have to start giving some things if they're going to expect to deal with anyone fairly.

They are, but we have to be prepared for "we don't like your deals, OG NUMBERS SMASH".

I'm still in favour of maybe trying to get Aguija to pull a Mekibos. Let's try to convince the rest of the team to give up a non-Number (er, actually, do we have any of those?), then get Vat Tran to let her hang with us for a bit. Then we can start protecting her and convincing Aguija that not all humans are barbarians blah blah blah. There's a lot of weak spots in this plan, but it's the best I can think of.

You reconvene back on the Trilobite. Echidna is finally showing something like an emotion, displeasure at you. "Lt Irm, why won't you keep your subordinates on a tighter leash? Even revealing the existence of the W-series to the Neo DC is contrary to my orders from Ms. Browning."

"I-I realise that, Echidna! It's just... well, I like having the whole teams input, when I can."

"Most of your team is too low-rank to even be aware of the W-series existence themselves. They're not qualified to advice you on them."

"Alright, alright. Look, Ryuune seems like a reasonable girl, I'm sure she'll come through for us, and the issue won't even come up anymore. Ok."

Echidna nods, but her mask is cracked, showing the annoyance underneath.

"Anyway...I'll talk to Vat Tran on whether there's anything he might want from us. Maybe if we get into his good books, he'll have that woman do it on his orders. Maybe we can damage the EFA in the area, or something. I'll leave my commlink open, if any of you need to contact me.

Irm leaves, leaving you with Kai and Echidna. You realise that the woman is making you quite uncomfortable with her silent treatment and stares.

PLOT IS COMING UP, BUT FIRST, SHALL WE HAVE KATINA DO SOMETHING? I'm open to any number of options

...Well, meeting's over.

Let's go find Lamia and seduce her with my patented "I'll teach you all about human feelings" line.

If we go the justice route later, we can give an impassioned speech about how even if you're body is fake, your soul is always your own. And if we go thr route of being the psychotic villain overlord, we can shatter her newly formed sense of love and attachment, and turn her into a hollow shell of her former self, making the battle against our former allies that much easier.

It's like a long term investment, with the short term benefit of being able to grab Lamia's bountiful chest. Brilliant!

You know, seducing Lamia or Latooni might be all well and good, but am I the only one slightly concerned about our little flashback to The School happening right in the middle of the meeting?

That's probably not something Katina wants to remember, and I'd imagine it would bother her. Maybe we should seek some advice about it.

Excellent. Go to Latooni, earn relationship points and character development. For best results, be a -little- dere. Not a lot, or we'll come off as crazy, but get just emotional enough to get the ice queen a little melty.

To elaborate a little more - the emotion we want to present is fear. We had a really scary thing happen back there, and Latooni's the only one we know who understands what it was like. Ask her for help.

Maybe it's time to have first discussion with Latooni that doesn't involve sexual intention and by that I mean, we should discuss school experience.

After that is done, Check how the Raioh repairs are going and have chat with Dumi.

You find Latooni on the top of Trilobite 1, looking out over the DC base with a pair of binoculars.

"Hey, Subota. Looking for anything in particular?"

"Weak points. Escape routes. Defensible positions. Killing ground."

"...Huh. Any particular reason?"

"Dozens, but primarily, in case the DC were to turn on us, and we needed to secure the alien and escape."

"Ok, forward thinking. Nice."

"I picked up a lot more than forward thinking at the School. Strategy is as important as twitch reflexes on the battlefield. Something I see you haven't learned, given the shape of your mech."

You ignore the blatant insult for now, and put a glum expression on your face. Not that Latooni is looking at you.

"Um, Subota...do you ever get...flashbacks, of what happened at the School?"

"It would be quite odd for a person to never remember what happened during the formative years of their lives."

"Unless that part of their brain had been altered..."

"Are you still so convinced it was the Schools tampering that causes your fragmented state of mind? It could simply be that you were always like that, and the School merely accentuated that weakness."

She's not de-icing like this, you think to yourself.

WILL WE TRY ANOTHER APPROACH, OR DO SOMETHING ELSE?

Once we're done with Latooni, I'd like to put a couple of things we really need to do on the table:

1. Corner Kai, get out the whole story on why he left the EFA and what he saw in there. He knows something, and while he's not trustworthy, I want to know what happened to him.

2. Corner Shu, find out what he's trying to protect earth from and what his plan is. Dumi raised some suspicions about him, but we don't entirely trust Dumi, so let's get the other side of the story.

...as for currently, maybe ask Latooni if she thinks the School did anything to her.

"C-come on, Subota! You can't keep treating me like a dog turd. We were in the School, one of the most horrible experiences on the planet! We have a shared history! And yet you treat me like a baby."

"Do you really think everyone in the School goes through the same thing, Tarask? How naive. The name is the biggest lie in the whole place. It's a laboratory, not a training centre. They experimented on us, threw hundreds of different experiences at us, and tried to find who excelled, who became flawed but usable, and who was only fit to be thrown away. You and your boy-toy Arado were bottom-tier, used for the wierder stuff, considered totally expendable. I was top of the class, and I was used to see how far the human mind and body could go. They constantly tested me, making me excel, but with so much caution, so little true risk. You're being treated like a baby? I was treated like the second coming, still in the womb!"

"S-subota!"

True emotion plays across Latoonis face for the first time you can remember. "I was so sick of it...Able to kill ten men with a pencil, fly a mech with 3 gunshot wounds to the chest, and they treated me like I was made of glass! I never even saw a real mech until I joined Shadow Mirror, it was all simulators before that. No risk...none! What the hell is the point of that kind of life, I ask you?"

"Subo...Lat, I never knew..."

"Didn't I just say that? How could you, the dregs, the envelope they scribbled their random thoughts onto...how could you understand a fake life when you had no life at all?"

The best response to that I can think of would be as follows.

"...Wanna go blow it up?"

And then Latooni and Katina go batshit on The School and destroy the entire complex, leaving nothing but ashes and rubble in their wake.

Relationship with Latooni goes up, and we capture some School mechs in the process if we leave a hangar or two standing. Everybody's happy.

Well, at least that's a change.

Meekly say "You are right, I didn't have a life back then. But now after joining the Shadow Mirrors I try to live impulsively and live my new life at its fullest. And I know that my impulsiveness makes me say and do stupid things, and I might say something stupid later on, but I want you to know that I really think of you as a friend.

The hug takes the bitter girl totally by surprise, and she stands stock-still, unsure whether to squirm away, or return it.

"Y-you're right, Subota, I didn't have a life back then. But now, now that I'm away from that place, I've been trying to live my new life at its fullest, without anyone telling me what to do. And I know I end up saying and doing stupid things, but I don't want any of you to think...that that makes me less willing to be your friend. When worst comes to worst, you can depend on me, Latooni."

"...When did this become about you? You...you random...spaz..."

"Latooni, what do I have to do...??"

Latooni pulls away from you, her expression softened but still angry. "Stop being a random element, Tarask. Start being a risk."

Silence. A sniff as you blink away a tear.

I bet she's referring to how so far we just seem to lash out randomly at everything around us. I think what we're supposed to take from this is that we need a goal, and we need to channel all of that psychotic fury into achieving that goal instead of dicking around for no real reason.

Think about it for a second. We're only here because there's nowhere else for us to go. It's not like we have a reason to fight this war, or a reason to protect the people we're allied with. We need to figure out just what the hell we want to do here, and then throw 110% of our spastic energy behind that goal until everything that stands in our path is a smoldering pile of ash and rubble.

It might very well be time to start considering if there's any benefit to staying with the shadow mirrors, or if we should strike out on our own for a bit and see what we really want to do in the world. For now, though, let's listen to what's going on. I have a feeling shit's about to hit the fan.

Isn't that basically what Dumi was going on about earlier? And we decided that our only real option was the Shadow Mirrors because who else would take us? Now that /m/ was swung back to liking justice as a goal instead of overlord route, we need to change the answer of "we fight for eternal war because we don't know what else to do" to something like "we fight for justice and protecting people because ___________".

The only correct answer is to have an epic battle with the darker half of our mind when Raioh's LIOH system finally takes it's eventual toll and drives us into BERSERKER MODE.

Wherein we kick ourselves in the brain and either become A HERO OF JUSTICE alongside Shu, or become THE DARK EQUALIZER and resolve ourselves to burn down the corrupt world around us.

I'm still of the opinion that we should tear their world to shit ourselves if we can manage it. They're doing the standard thing in tv shows and games that deal with alternate realities in that they're assuming that the "main" reality is inherently superior to the others.

Best motivation I can figure for our psychodere Katina as she is now, is "We fight for justice and protecting people because that way we can wreck shit and kill people, and the people we protect will actually like us for it."
Also I was bored, and the OP pic gave me an outlet, so here's my coloration for our Invincible Earth Liberation Warrior.

Gilliam just said he wanted to avoid an alien invasion in this world, and this is our usual group of heroes, so they're probably not that bad. Honestly, if there's anyone in this world we can sway to be helpful it's them.

We fight for justice and protecting people because of the painful and pointless deaths of Kai and Latooni.

Kai's defection was a ruse set up by the rebels. It was all a big drama staged by the Divine Crusaders so they could free themselves from the grasp of the EFA, and Kai was the star of the show. They planned it so they could get the freedom the EFA stole from them and destroy the Queen Einst at the same time.Only a legendary hero like Kai Kitamura could have earned Beowulf's trust. Finding out a way to liberate all the victims of the Einst invasion was to be his greatest mission. Everything was going according to plan.

Then something happened that noone could have predicted. Beowulf deployed the Valsion into the South American rebel base. The rest of the rebel groups demanded to show proof that the Divine Crusaders weren't involved. They couldn't just afford the operation to steal their freedom, so the operation itself was greatly expanded and revised. The leaders of the DC knew that in order to proof their innocence they had to get rid of Kai, and that one of their own would have to do the job. The public couldn't be allowed to find out about it. Not ever. This, they concluded, would be the best way to keep the whole thing under wraps.

Kai Kitamura wouldn't be allowed to come back home alive, and he wouldn't be allowed to kill himself. His life would be ended by his most beloved disciple. That was the way the DC wanted it. That was the mission he was given, and he had no choice but to carry it out. His death in your hands was the duty he had to fulfill. Out of duty he turned his back on his own comrades. A lesser man would have been crushed by such a burden.

The tainted disgrace will follow him to his grave. Future generations will revile him. In the DC as a despicable traitor with no sense of honor. And in the rest of the world as a monster who unleashed a gravitational catastrophe. He will go down in official history as a war criminal, and noone will ever understand him. That was his final mission, and like a true soldier he saw it thru to the end. But I think he wanted you, of all people, to know the truth. He wanted to live on in your memory. Not as a soldier, but as a man. But he was forbidden to tell you himself and that's why he told me.

"Ok people, here's the deal." Irm looks unusually determined. "We recieved the distress signal 3 hours ago, which lasted for 35 minutes before the EFA started jamming it, just like they did TLI. We have to assume that means they're taking it as a threat."

Russel looks confused. "Why? It's just a hole in the ground, isn't it?"

"Thats exactly the point, Bags. The EFA destroyed the Earth Cradle months ago, stuffed it full of MAPWs and gutted the whole thing. The very idea that theres someone alive down there, after all this time, is crazy in itself. Add that its Sophia Nate, one of the DCs top scientists, and it becomes more pressing."

"So, what do we do?"

"Vat Tran is deploying a shuttle and a squad of his best troops to recover her, but we have no way of knowing what force the EFA is sending thanks to the jamming. So I offered to send one of our Trilobites and a contingent to support the. If we get Dr. Nate and any intact Earth Cradle technology back safely, he says he'll get us this dimension scanner."

Ryuune nods. "Too good an offer to pass up."

"Exactly."

Katina.

History will never know what he did.

Noone will ever learn the truth.

His story, his loyalty will only endure in your heart.

Everything he did, he did it for his comrades. He sacrificed his life and hid honour for his country.

He was a real hero. He was a true patriot.

Valsione and Cybuster can go, since MAP attacks are always good. Bullet can go to to keep an eye on them. Latooni in Soldier, she wanted some risks so here we go. Let's try Ibis in the Rathgith.

...is the Angelg free? I vote we toss Irm in there.

Well all those EFA folks ganging up on a woman sounds like some INJUSTICE to me, so of course Shu is coming, and assuming he can't warp our team there, we need to move fast, so Masaki and Lune are in, and somebody in the Wildraubtier.
Dumi comes, seeing as this is a rescue mission, we might need the defense. Vysaga should be good for general disruption of the enemy, then bring the Soldifar and a Gespenst.

This. Also have Ibis pilot the Rathgrith instead of the Schutzwald. Bring up efficiency in order to get Echidna out of the cockpit. Ibis' file likely mentions her extreme skill in solid projectile weaponry.

If that fails have Katina moe-face Irm to order her to let Ibis have the Rathgrith.

The question we should be asking here is if Vat Tran has any equippable weapons we can borrow. A Rectangular Launcher or G-Railgun should work just fine.
