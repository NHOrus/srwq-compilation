## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 17: Spreading Justice by kicking things with fire

The needles are on your brain, pumping in the fire. The simulator... No, it's real youregonnadie the mech is spinning through the curtains of bullet, and Old Man Adler is screaming you, stop being a failure, why are all of you failures, and you have no choice but to shoot at the target, and you paint Her face on each of them but you can still here the babies screaming... or is it you?


"Any ideas, guys?"

You blink and you're back in the meeting room, in the middle of Africa. Irm's brow is furrowed as he looks over the group. Behind him, Aguija, the last Inspector, grins dismissively at all of you, while Van Vat Tran sit silently, taking it all in.

"We need to get her cooperation, but she's not just going to give it. We'll have to come up with a better deal, one that'll get us the technology but keep us in the DCs good books. Kai?"

Kai just blinks at him. "I thought you were supposed to stop trusting me and following all my advice."

"You choose now to be unhelpful."

"I want to see if you kids can handle this without me."

"So, you're a scientist, a handler of technology, Aguija?"

"I'm the closest thing this mudball has."

"So if there were technologies you didn't have, that we could give you access to, would you be interested in that in exchange for the dimensional thingie?"

"I highly doubt there's anything of merit left on your planet that Wendolo didn't already pilfer."

"Well, there are two things I can think of. Firstly, the Irregulars have all of their other-dimension technology, if you were to come with us you could get access to that. Or, if you want something now, we has samples for you."

"Samples?"

"The perfect pilots, with all the piloting skill of a human but totally obedient. You could make use of that, right?"

Echidna turns to you. "Lt. Tarask, you don't have any authority to make that kind of offer."

Ryuune also speaks out. "And you can't offer them our technology just like that, either!"

"Come on Irm, this is the best chance we have! We can't pass this up over a few weak objections."

Irm furrows his brow, looking over at the other two women. "Well... we have to do something... but I don't know about handing people over to her, that doesn't seem right, even if they have been altered."

"Then tell Ryuune to stop being stubborn! Her forces got us into this mess, she owes us!"

Ryuune shakes her head. "It's not about being tight-fisted with technology, it's about her. We fought her and her team in our world too, and they used every scrap of technology they could get to wage war on us. We can't trust her with the kind of secrets we have, she'll turn them on us!"

Vat Tran stands up at this. "I assure you, Ms Zoldark, if the alien does any 'turning' it'll be at my command and mine only. Her life is subborned to the Neo DC, and what technology she makes, is ours."

Aquija mutters something that her translator fails to translate. Vat Tran ignores her.

Ryuune looks thoughtful for a moment. "I... I'll have to talk it over with the others."

---

You reconvene back on the Trilobite. Echidna is finally showing something like an emotion, displeasure at you. "Lt Irm, why won't you keep your subordinates on a tighter leash? Even revealing the existence of the W-series to the Neo DC is contrary to my orders from Ms. Browning."

"I-I realise that, Echidna! It's just... well, I like having the whole teams input, when I can."

"Most of your team is too low-rank to even be aware of the W-series existence themselves. They're not qualified to advice you on them."

"Alright, alright. Look, Ryuune seems like a reasonable girl, I'm sure she'll come through for us, and the issue won't even come up anymore. Ok."

Echidna nods, but her mask is cracked, showing the annoyance underneath.

"Anyway... I'll talk to Vat Tran on whether there's anything he might want from us. Maybe if we get into his good books, he'll have that woman do it on his orders. Maybe we can damage the EFA in the area, or something. I'll leave my commlink open, if any of you need to contact me.

Irm leaves, leaving you with Kai and Echidna. You realise that the woman is making you quite uncomfortable with her silent treatment and stares.

---

You find Latooni on the top of Trilobite 1, looking out over the DC base with a pair of binoculars.

"Hey, Subota. Looking for anything in particular?"

"Weak points. Escape routes. Defensible positions. Killing ground."

"...Huh. Any particular reason?"

"Dozens, but primarily, in case the DC were to turn on us, and we needed to secure the alien and escape."

"Ok, forward thinking. Nice."

"I picked up a lot more than forward thinking at the School. Strategy is as important as twitch reflexes on the battlefield. Something I see you haven't learned, given the shape of your mech."

You ignore the blatant insult for now, and put a glum expression on your face. Not that Latooni is looking at you.

"Um, Subota...do you ever get... lashbacks, of what happened at the School?"

"It would be quite odd for a person to never remember what happened during the formative years of their lives."

"Unless that part of their brain had been altered..."

"Are you still so convinced it was the Schools tampering that causes your fragmented state of mind? It could simply be that you were always like that, and the School merely accentuated that weakness."

She's not de-icing like this, you think to yourself.

"C-come on, Subota! You can't keep treating me like a dog turd. We were in the School, one of the most horrible experiences on the planet! We have a shared history! And yet you treat me like a baby."

"Do you really think everyone in the School goes through the same thing, Tarask? How naive. The name is the biggest lie in the whole place. It's a laboratory, not a training centre. They experimented on us, threw hundreds of different experiences at us, and tried to find who excelled, who became flawed but usable, and who was only fit to be thrown away. You and your boy-toy Arado were bottom-tier, used for the wierder stuff, considered totally expendable. I was top of the class, and I was used to see how far the human mind and body could go. They constantly tested me, making me excel, but with so much caution, so little true risk. You're being treated like a baby? I was treated like the second coming, still in the womb!"

"S-subota!"

True emotion plays across Latoonis face for the first time you can remember. "I was so sick of it... Able to kill ten men with a pencil, fly a mech with 3 gunshot wounds to the chest, and they treated me like I was made of glass! I never even saw a real mech until I joined Shadow Mirror, it was all simulators before that. No risk... none! What the hell is the point of that kind of life, I ask you?"

"Subo... Lat, I never knew..."

"Didn't I just say that? How could you, the dregs, the envelope they scribbled their random thoughts onto... how could you understand a fake life when you had no life at all?"

The hug takes the bitter girl totally by surprise, and she stands stock-still, unsure whether to squirm away, or return it.

"Y-you're right, Subota, I didn't have a life back then. But now, now that I'm away from that place, I've been trying to live my new life at its fullest, without anyone telling me what to do. And I know I end up saying and doing stupid things, but I don't want any of you to think... that that makes me less willing to be your friend. When worst comes to worst, you can depend on me, Latooni."

"...When did this become about you? You... you random... spaz..."

"Latooni, what do I have to do...??"

Latooni pulls away from you, her expression softened but still angry. "Stop being a random element, Tarask. Start being a risk."

Silence. A sniff as you blink away a tear.

"All Shadow Mirrors, come in! This is Lt. Irm, set your nearest comm-station to frequency 1992.5 immediately!!!"

---

"Do we really have to do this, Gilliam? We fought the Inspectors, we know what might happen if we give them any new technology."

"I know very well what it might entail, Ryuune, better than you may think. And I certainly don't want to be the one that dooms this world to alien invasion if I can avoid it. But our other leads aren't helping us very much. The Kurogane is being harried in the Pacific, the Hiryu lost the trail of the target in Canada, and what few people I've been able to get in contact with have been little help."

"But... if we did give her some technology, how could we ensure she didn't use it against the earth?"

"I may have to find that out personally. I'll have to make some arrang-"

"All Shadow Mirrors, come in! This is Lt. Irm, set your nearest comm-station to frequency 1992.5 immediately!!!"

"Wha-" Ryuune adjusts her coom station so both she and Gilliam can listen in to the incoming broadcast.

"-epeat, this is Sophia Nate, calling from the Earth Cradle. I require immediate assistance, please, anyone, come to my aid. Otherwise, we'll be lost..."

---

"Ok people, here's the deal." Irm looks unusually determined. "We recieved the distress signal 3 hours ago, which lasted for 35 minutes before the EFA started jamming it, just like they did TLI. We have to assume that means they're taking it as a threat."

Russel looks confused. "Why? It's just a hole in the ground, isn't it?"

"Thats exactly the point, Bags. The EFA destroyed the Earth Cradle months ago, stuffed it full of MAPWs and gutted the whole thing. The very idea that theres someone alive down there, after all this time, is crazy in itself. Add that its Sophia Nate, one of the DCs top scientists, and it becomes more pressing."

"So, what do we do?"

"Vat Tran is deploying a shuttle and a squad of his best troops to recover her, but we have no way of knowing what force the EFA is sending thanks to the jamming. So I offered to send one of our Trilobites and a contingent to support the. If we get Dr. Nate and any intact Earth Cradle technology back safely, he says he'll get us this dimension scanner."

Ryuune nods. "Too good an offer to pass up."

"Exactly."
