# Episode 35

##SRWQ Mission 35: More Dramatic Foils than a Shakespearean Fencing Club

In our last thread, Katina Tarask escaped the Einst deathtrap in northeast China, and delivered the crippled Dr. Juergens to hospital, but not before receiving a stark warning about the missing Dumi. Now, a few hours from rejoining the other Shadow Mirrors, a mysterious robot appears before their vunerable transport, and our heroine launches into another dangerous battle...

---

"Kai, it definitely an alien mech, not even disguised this time. They're getting less subtle..."

"Well, at least there's only one this time."

The girls giggle resounds through the comm netwrork. "One is all thats needed. I've been waiting for this."

Lemon gasps. "Y-You hear her, right? She's not just in my head?"

Vindel looks incredibly worried. Kai checks the radio. "This is an excrypted channel, how is she-?"

"Irrelevant. Pilot of the Super Robot, you've seen off Uncle Albero twice now, but now you face a Trueborn of the First. Would you like to see what the future of humanity can do?"

"D'AWWWW!!"

"??"

"What a cute little girl! Almost enough to make me forget you're piloting a freakish abomination from beyond beyond."

"Are you mocking me, Lightning Wielder?"

"Some one needs a huuu-uug...."

"...Who do you think you are? My mother?"

You raise an eyebrow. The giggly tone is gone.

"Do you think I'm some baby playing with matches? I know what I'm doing."

"I'm just saying, your voice gives me an irrational urge to cuddle you."

"And you're definitely one for irrational urges..."

"Shut up, Kai."

The mech-thing draws its Katana and goes into a fighting stance. "I am not your teddy-bear, Lightning Wielder, I'm Alfimi Personlichkiet, warrior of the Trueborn! I won't be treated like a baby!"

"Ok then... I won't hug you. I'll embrace you!"

"What?"

"I WANT TO EMBRACE YOU, ALFIMI!" The plasma leaders snake out at the red mech-thing. They burst against... something, some THINGS, a few metres short of the target. As lightning crackles around Alfimi, you think you see shapes forming from the lightning, like theres something in the way, soaking up the lightning.

"Oh, you want to get physical, is that it?" Alfimi bursts forward, and swings her blade. It cuts along the Raiohs arm. Another flash, and a gouge appears in the lower torso.

"YES!! I love physical!" You kick upwards, forcing her back, then punch forward, hitting her in the free arm. She dances around you, jabbing out with the sword to keep your grip away.

"If you want me, come and claim me! The universe won't come to those who sit on their behinds!"

"My, Miss Alfimi... You know just what to say to get a girl interested!!"

The Raioh impales itself on the blade, the tip scraping the side of your cockpit, then wraps its arms around the red mech, catching the thing in a tight bear hug. The Plasma Leaders snap together as they switch to alternate polarities, sealing the bond. The Einst-machine struggles in vain.

"You're coming home with me, girl. I'm going to strap you to a table and dissect you... with my tongue."

"Urgh... Nice fantasy... but can you handle a foursome?"

The shadowy shapes flicker out of nothingness, giant masks, with arms, and swords, and nothing else. The two identical blades rise to a striking position.

"What's wrong? You said you wanted my body, and here are all the parts of it. Am I too much woman for you?"

"Theres no such thing as too much woman!" You flip over as the blades fall, placing the red mech between the blades and you.

The blades phase through Alfimi, and pass into the Raioh arms.

Power to the arms fail as conduits are cut. The Lichkeit breaks free, wrenching out its katana as the twin swords hold the Raioh up like a trophy. Alfimi scrapes her blade along the Raioh's crotchplate. "Shall I move on to the penetration?"

You buck the Raioh around, but the blades only dig in deeper. "Damn... haven't you... heard of foreplay?"

"This is my first time. It's meant to be awkward... and messy." She brings the blade to a stabbing position, aiming it at your cockpit.

Then the blade dissappears.

The light on the Granzon's chest escalates again, and another sphere of absolute darkness forms. "Now, I not entirely what all this odd dialogue is implying, but I'm afraid I'll have to ask you girls to stop fighting. I've made it my mission to stop senseless violence in this world, even if some people enjoy it happening to them."

The armed masks fade away, dropping the ruined arms to the Raiohs side as the Machine Cells kick in. The Lichkeit steps backward, as space folds about it.

"Well done, Katina Tarask. You've shown humanity still has elements worthy of preserving. I don't doubt that we'll renew this later." The giggle is back in her voice.

"Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I hate long-distance relationships."

The Lichkiet is gone. The Eurydice rises out of the water, flashing code at the transport. Shuu extends a hand.

"Ms Tarask, if you would, there are some things we need to discuss."

"Why are you here? You should be back in Africa with Dumi and the others."

Shuu looks grim as he walks down the ladder from the Granzon. "We got... a little lost, along the way. But the main reason we stayed in the ocean rather than proceeding on is that your friend Dumi said to."

"What?"

"He sent a message to Captain Despinis, using a dimensional wave method that I wasn't expecting, that there was 'no point' in returning to Africa, and that 'the survivors' would rendevous with us presently."

"S-survivors? What does that mean? D-did something happen to them?"

"I do not know, Miss Tar-"

"THEN WHAT FUCKING GOOD IS THE MESSAGE THEN??"

"Please, remain cal-"

"FUCK CALM!! For all we know, they could all be dead but that bitch Echidna! I won't stand for this!!"

"Maybe Ms Despinis can request clarification from Dumi..."

You give Shuu a withering look. He recoils slightly.

Confident the Machine Cells will fix the Raioh presently, you patch a comm terminal into the Eurydices bridge. Despinis is alone except for Commander Enfield, who seems to be intently studying a computer screen in the corner. Despinis lazily raises her head. "Yes?"

"I want to talk to Dumi. Now."

"Hold on." Despinis tilts her head to one side, and silently waits for a few seconds. You're about to yell at her to hurry when the image is replaced with the Diamond Eye, and a familiar voice begins buzzing in your earpiece.

*I'll skip the formalities, I think. The short answer is that the Project SRX team attacked us, as a sort of test. They came in, fought us for shits and giggles, and left again. There wasn't much we could do.*

"Uh... is everyone... ok?"

*The Van Vat Tran faction of the Divine Crusaders doesn't exist anymore as a viable military threat. Its forces were wiped out and its last base half-vaporised. Only my link to Sophia Nate lets me know that Vat Tran is alive at all.*

"Dumi, I don't give a shit about Vat Tran. What happened to the Shadow Mirrors."

*Where to begin...*

---

Irm twitches uncomfortably, as his arm twinges in the sling. "Ryuune, can't you just stay a little longer? Just while we're getting ourselves together. Even just one or two of you, while we sort ourselves out..."

Ryuune looks up at the busted exterior of the Valsione, then out of the Trilobite, across the blasted wasteland to where the XN Giest hovered. "I... Would we really be helping you, Irm? Ever since we got here, it's seemed like we've been the ones causing trouble, provoking your world like idiots kicking over an ants nest. And, besides, I saw that transmission. You should have enough of a grace period to sort something out."

"Ryuune... do you really think that this'll stop once you all leave? Don't you see you've got to help us put it right?"

"...We have enough problems keeping our own world right, Irm. Its... Its best if you handle it." She walks to the ladder.

"...Can I at least get your phone number?"

"One of your arms is broken, and the other is bandaged like a mummy. You couldn't type in a phone number even if I had one."

"Never underestimate a lovestruck fool."

Ryuune pecks him on the cheek. "Best of luck, Irm." Then she climbs into the Valsione.

---

The two Arados stare at each other blankly.

"And nothing happened?"

"Not for her lack of trying, I'll say that much."

"...She's gotten worse. I'll... I'll have to fix her."

"Better you than me, buddy." The living Arado climbs atop the Huckebiens hand, and Tandem 1 lifts him up with Seolla.

The girl looks over the side at the dead thing below. "D... Don't you hurt her, ok?"

The Dead Arado just turns and walks off. "Why shouldn't I?", he whispers, touching his fingers to the scar at his neck, the one he wouldn't let the Machine Cells heal.

---

Lamia grunts as Axel shakes his head blankly. "Nope, never heard of the guy."

"You don't remember Beowulf? Seriously?"

"I don't see why I should..."

"Kyosuke Nanbu, pilot of the Gespenst MkIII, leader of the ATX Team. The team you served on for years."

"Nope... Was that a DC thing or a ELF thing?"

"The ATX Team are the EFA's top Squadron! The most infamous fighting unit on the planet!!"

"I thought that was the Agressors..."

Lamia groans.

---

Seolla squirms in the bonds. Latooni raps the ruler in her hand.

"You cost us big, having me blow up my suit and yours to make them think you were dead. I really would have liked to use that new sniper unit..."

"Y-y-you know you can't torture m-me... School Training m-m-makes it impossible."

"Oh? I don't know, since I don't think you went through all the training Seolla. Its obvious you're damaged goods, like Katina. You're nowhere on the level of me or Ouka."

"I... I won't..." Seolla squeeks as Latooni tears off the shoulders of her uniform.

"I don't doubt it would take me a while... but then, I don't really need to waste my time." She tosses the patch of fabric to the floor. "Theres a woman coming here, her free time is much less valuable, and she's a lot more willing to... degrade herself, than I am, over a trivial morsel like you. Yes, I'd imagine she'd have fun breaking you down."

Latooni turns and walks to the door. "Not sure when she'll be back though. Could be hours, could be days. If you'd rather avoid the unpleasantness, I suggest you start considering how much you like those clothes... and your virginity."

The door closes behind Latooni as the squeeking sobs begin.

---

Ring looks blankly at the stump of her right hand. She thought she could still feel the fingers, vaguely. She imagined herself making a fist, catching a butterfly in midair. It didn't help.

"Um, Ms Mao." Kusuha looked rather haggard, but otherwise fine. "We've doubled checked the inventory. There should be enough parts to replace your hand as well as Mr Medio's limbs. Once things settle down a little more, we can replace them all relatively quickly."

Ring sits up and looks about the medbay. Johnathan sleeps soundly, the bullet wound in his arm bandaged nicely. Ryo rubs at the bandages where he recieved his head blow. Brooklyn helps the battered Toby Watson back into bed, beside the comatose Setsuko.

"What about Jayce?" It wasn't even a question. She'd been too slow, couldn't gain altitude in time. Dumb bastard put himself in front of her, typical Lenonjayce...

"...Ms Iisaki... she says... her methods can... bring him back... partially. The damage is extensive, but she said there was an 83% of the... procedure... going..." Kusuha begins to wail. "He'll be one of them!! One of those bug-eyed monsters! Why would you let her do that to him?!? He'd rather be dead!"

Ring looks at the space where her hand should be "...Maybe. Ever since Minas accident, dumb shitheads hasn't lived for himself, he's just worked for me, supported me, kept me safe..." The tears come without her bidding. "I need him..."

---

Ratsel and Sanger watch as Gilliam replays the message again. It must be the 8 or 9th time, but the intelligence agent keeps playing it, looking for subtle nuances, hidden clues, something to help make sense of it.

Yukiko Date sits on her desk, glaring straight at the Camera. "Irregulars, Shadow Mirrors. You should both have found copies of this recording after our battle. I won't bother with pleasantries."

"I created Project SRX under the tutelage of Bian Zoldark, because I beleived in him, and his manifesto against the alien influence affecting our world. I could not follow him on his reckless quest for domination, and eventually it fell to me and my subordinates to end the threat he represented, but I have always held to the core of his message: That mankind alone should influence mankinds destiny. This is why I work within the Federation, because it is there that the greatest threat to mankinds sovreignty can be found."

"The EFA itself is of little concern to us, our agents can nuetralise their conventional forces without firing a shot. But the First, this mysterious race that created the EFA, are subtle, and their true strength hidden. We cannot strike until we can be sure of total victory. You can make that possible."

"I have 48 hours from the time of our assault on your base to confirm its success. If in that time, I do not recieve word from your factions that you will work with us, I will be forced to destroy you. All Irregular and Shadow Mirror targets in our database will be anhilated, and believe me when I say that our list of targets is longer than you think. However, if you cooperate with us, our projected battle strength will be enough to take on even our worst-case scenarios. We can destroy the First and install a proper, human government overseeing this world. The benefits to all of mankind are plain."

The message ends, likely because Date felt nothing else needed to be said. Gilliams finger hovers over the replay button.

Ratsel coughs. "Gilliam... are we going to respond?"

"We've confirmed everyone except Shine and Latooni. Find them, destroy the Zweizergain, and we can be out of this world before her timelimit expires. No, we don't have to send her anything."

"It's what the Shadow Mirrors are going to say, thats what worries me."

---

The statue's exterior cracks. Dead metal crumbles away, revealing fresh white beneath. Somethine stirs.

"Repairs at 39%... Machine Cells proceeding at maximum rate. Magus, your Sword will be ready within a day."

The hyperwave penetrates through meters of earth, rock, metal and concrete with ease. "Yes... these blasted Cells, they'd thrive in this charnel pit, wouldn't they? The souls of the murdered, the pain of the wounded, its like manna for them..."

"....Magus..."

"Sophia! My name is Sophia, you damned robot!!"

"...Sophia... it hurts... to think of you... as that woman... about the time... we had together...."

"Oh Sanger... damn this cursed existence we've been given... The Machine Cells were meant to preserve life, to protect it and seed the Earth with it after an apocalypse, but now... I've created an apocalypse of my own..."

---

Vat Trans eyes glow as the vats of Cells slowly, ever so slowly, fill, the artificial microbe breeding at a slow but steady rate.

"Heh... kill my men... crush my robots... sink my battleships... All pointless now, you bastards. I'll remake the DC, I'll raise my army from the grave! We'll crawl out of hell to strike you down, you imperialist bastards. This world... this world isn't yours anymore! It never was! You fucking vampires will all crumble to dust under our deathless boots!"

Vat Tran grins. Then he snorts. Then he starts to cackle.

"Goddamn ape, going mad over a bit of nanotech..." Aquija slips the last component out of its hiding place and inserts it into the device, tuning the commlink to the chosen frequency. "Z, come in. Come in, you bastard! These DC fools have finally gotten themselves killed, I need pickup, now!"

"Do you know who just landed in the middle of Geneva, in broad daylight?"

"No, I-"

"Balmarians. Honest-to-god Balmarians. We've been hunting down the last of the bastards for Grengons, and it turns out they were hiding in an asteroid the whole time. Thats something, ain't it?"

"Z, I really don't kurfing care. Just send Sabine, and drill me out of here. I've been with these monkeys too long, I'm going to start growing body hair soon."

"Alright, alright. But Aquija dear, its not as simple as you think. These First are smart bastards, and their pet humans are irritatingly resourceful. The simplest thing for me to do is send one of my puppets after you, he should keep your safe."

"A human, keep me safe?"

"Well, he promised he'd keep this whole planet safe, so I have to at least give him a chance..."

---

The Thugater moans in Tis' head, asking her to lift the ugly disguise and let its true form shine out again. Tis quiets its pseudomind and Hyperwaves to Master again.

"Aren't you going to block the Aliens transmission? You examined the Zuvorg, didn't you? You know they're a threat. If they send Guests, this whole planet is-"

*I'm not sure single planets matter anymore, Tis. Frankly, If the entire galaxy where to fold in on itself to end this, I'd call it a good deal.*

"Master... what is it thats frightening you so? Can't you explain it to me?"

*I will, Tis, right after someone explains it to me.*

"Oh... Master... Shouldn't we just complete the mission and leave? You said the target was here on this world after all."

*If I so much as twitch from this spot, Mr Yeager over there is liable to turn me inside out. I'd send Lalia and Despinis, but with the Kaiser inside the Irregular flagship, they won't have the combat strength, and we have no leverage to ask for it peacefully. They've fought My Master before, remember? They know what the Kaiser means to him, they won't give it to us.*

"So... what do we do?"

*This goddamn storm... I can't use my hyper-computation units or my Mind Impulse Planes... I... I can't think of anything conventionally....Dammit, I need her. Its gotten so bad... I near her just to figure out a simple theft for me... Oh, if My Master saw me now, he'd flay me to atoms for such weakness. Such a way to fall...*

---

"Well, at least theres some eatin' in the food."

Russell devours his plate of stew, gulping it down with the water. Ibis simply flicks her fork through hers, then offers the plate to the still-hungry Irishman. He takes it, but looks curiously at her. She puts her face against the cell wall, feeling the vibrations of the Kurogane.

"48 hours... Do you really think they won't... interrogate us for that long? That they'll let us go if the others agree to help them?"

"I dunno, Douglas. It sounds a bit off, but these EFA jecks, they're meant to be tricksy bastards. Kai said they'd offered him a job, and him a wanted man. Using terrorists ain't so different."

"And when they're done with us? When we beat this other faction for them?"

Russel simply shrugs.

The silence settles, and is broken again. "What are you doing in Shadow Mirror, anyway?"

Russel shrugs again. "Some gobshite pilot from Belfast Base threw a beer bottle at my head one night. It just sort've... went from there."

Ibis looks at her cellmate incredulously. Then she snorts. Then the two burst into peals of laughter, which rings down the corridors of the massive, yet terribly empty vessel.
