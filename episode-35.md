In our last thread, Katina Tarask escaped the Einst deathtrap in northeast China, and delivered the crippled Dr. Juergens to hospital, but not before receiving a stark warning about the missing Dumi. Now, a few hours from rejoining the other Shadow Mirrors, a mysterious robot appears before their vunerable transport, and our heroine launches into another dangerous battle...

Launch in Raioh, and get ready to face off against SM!Alfimi if necessary.

SM!Alfimi's existence is a bit of a plothole, since Lemon exists because Excellen -wasn't- abducted by the Einst, but whatever. New loli for the harem and all that jazz.

"Kai, it definitely an alien mech, not even disguised this time. They're getting less subtle..."

"Well, at least there's only one this time."

The girls giggle resounds through the comm netwrork. "One is all thats needed. I've been waiting for this."

Lemon gasps. "Y-You hear her, right? She's not just in my head?"

Vindel looks incredibly worried. Kai checks the radio. "This is an excrypted channel, how is she-?"

"Irrelevant. Pilot of the Super Robot, you've seen off Uncle Albero twice now, but now you face a Trueborn of the First. Would you like to see what the future of humanity can do?"

RESPONSE FROM KATINA?

"Piss off, we don't have time for you." Unless we get visual contact. In that case, squee and glomp the Lichkeit with the Raioh.

Also, inquire if the girl is asking for a one-on-one duel. Also find out why she's taken such an interest in us in particular.

She came all the way here to see us, after all.

"What a cute little girl! Almost enough to make me forget you're piloting a freakish abomination from beyond beyond."

"Are you mocking me, Lightning Wielder?"

"Some one needs a huuu-uug...."

"...Who do you think you are? My mother?"

You raise an eyebrow. The giggly tone is gone.

"Do you think I'm some baby playing with matches? I know what I'm doing."

"I'm just saying, your voice gives me an irrational urge to cuddle you."

"And you're definitely one for irrational urges..."

"Shut up, Kai."

The mech-thing draws its Katana and goes into a fighting stance. "I am not your teddy-bear, Lightning Wielder, I'm Alfimi Personlichkiet, warrior of the Trueborn! I won't be treated like a baby!"

If she's in such a rush to act mature, she'll miss out on the joys of youth.

Now, ask her if she'd prefer to face us one-on-one, and what's in it for us if we accept that offer for a duel. Information on the First and Only would be a suitable wager.

"Ok then...I won't hug you. I'll embrace you!"

"What?"

"I WANT TO EMBRACE YOU, ALFIMI!" The plasma leaders snake out at the red mech-thing. They burst against....something, some THINGS, a few metres short of the target. As lightning crackles around Alfimi, you think you see shapes forming from the lightning, like theres something in the way, soaking up the lightning.

"Oh, you want to get physical, is that it?" Alfimi bursts forward, and swings her blade. It cuts along the Raiohs arm. Another flash, and a gouge appears in the lower torso.

"YES!! I love physical!" You kick upwards, forcing her back, then punch forward, hitting her in the free arm. She dances around you, jabbing out with the sword to keep your grip away.

"If you want me, come and claim me! The universe won't come to those who sit on their behinds!"

"My, Miss Alfimi...You know just what to say to get a girl interested!!"

The Raioh impales itself on the blade, the tip scraping the side of your cockpit, then wraps its arms around the red mech, catching the thing in a tight bear hug. The Plasma Leaders snap together as they switch to alternate polarities, sealing the bond. The Einst-machine struggles in vain.

"You're coming home with me, girl. I'm going to strap you to a table and dissect you...with my tongue."

"Urgh...Nice fantasy...but can you handle a foursome?"

The shadowy shapes flicker out of nothingness, giant masks, with arms, and swords, and nothing else. The two identical blades rise to a striking position.

"What's wrong? You said you wanted my body, and here are all the parts of it. Am I too much woman for you?"

"Theres no such thing as too much woman!" You flip over as the blades fall, placing the red mech between the blades and you.

The blades phase through Alfimi, and pass into the Raioh arms.

Power to the arms fail as conduits are cut. The Lichkeit breaks free, wrenching out its katana as the twin swords hold the Raioh up like a trophy. Alfimi scrapes her blade along the Raioh's crotchplate. "Shall I move on to the penetration?"

You buck the Raioh around, but the blades only dig in deeper. "Damn...haven't you...heard of foreplay?"

"This is my first time. It's meant to be awkward...and messy." She brings the blade to a stabbing position, aiming it at your cockpit.

Then the blade dissappears.

The light on the Granzon's chest escalates again, and another sphere of absolute darkness forms. "Now, I not entirely what all this odd dialogue is implying, but I'm afraid I'll have to ask you girls to stop fighting. I've made it my mission to stop senseless violence in this world, even if some people enjoy it happening to them."

The armed masks fade away, dropping the ruined arms to the Raiohs side as the Machine Cells kick in. The Lichkeit steps backward, as space folds about it.

"Well done, Katina Tarask. You've shown humanity still has elements worthy of preserving. I don't doubt that we'll renew this later." The giggle is back in her voice.

"Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. I hate long-distance relationships."

The Lichkiet is gone. The Eurydice rises out of the water, flashing code at the transport. Shuu extends a hand.

"Ms Tarask, if you would, there are some things we need to discuss."

"Why are you here? You should be back in Africa with Dumi and the others."

Shuu looks grim as he walks down the ladder from the Granzon. "We got...a little lost, along the way. But the main reason we stayed in the ocean rather than proceeding on is that your friend Dumi said to."

"What?"

"He sent a message to Captain Despinis, using a dimensional wave method that I wasn't expecting, that there was 'no point' in returning to Africa, and that 'the survivors' would rendevous with us presently."

"S-survivors? What does that mean? D-did something happen to them?"

"I do not know, Miss Tar-"

Confident the Machine Cells will fix the Raioh presently, you patch a comm terminal into the Eurydices bridge. Despinis is alone except for Commander Enfield, who seems to be intently studying a computer screen in the corner. Despinis lazily raises her head. "Yes?"

"I want to talk to Dumi. Now."

"Hold on." Despinis tilts her head to one side, and silently waits for a few seconds. You're about to yell at her to hurry when the image is replaced with the Diamond Eye, and a familiar voice begins buzzing in your earpiece.

I'll skip the formalities, I think. The short answer is that the Project SRX team attacked us, as a sort of test. They came in, fought us for shits and giggles, and left again. There wasn't much we could do.

"Uh....is everyone...ok?"

The Van Vat Tran faction of the Divine Crusaders doesn't exist anymore as a viable military threat. Its forces were wiped out and its last base half-vaporised. Only my link to Sophia Nate lets me know that Vat Tran is alive at all.

Ryuune looks up at the busted exterior of the Valsione, then out of the Trilobite, across the blasted wasteland to where the XN Giest hovered. "I...Would we really be helping you, Irm? Ever since we got here, it's seemed like we've been the ones causing trouble, provoking your world like idiots kicking over an ants nest. And, besides, I saw that transmission. You should have enough of a grace period to sort something out."

"Ryuune...do you really think that this'll stop once you all leave? Don't you see you've got to help us put it right?"

"...We have enough problems keeping our own world right, Irm. Its..Its best if you handle it." She walks to the ladder.

"...Can I at least get your phone number?"

"One of your arms is broken, and the other is bandaged like a mummy. You couldn't type in a phone number even if I had one."

"Never underestimate a lovestruck fool."

Ryuune pecks him on the cheek. "Best of luck, Irm." Then she climbs into the Valsione.

Ring looks blankly at the stump of her right hand. She thought she could still feel the fingers, vaguely. She imagined herself making a fist, catching a butterfly in midair. It didn't help.

"Um, Ms Mao." Kusuha looked rather haggard, but otherwise fine. "We've doubled checked the inventory. There should be enough parts to replace your hand as well as Mr Medio's limbs. Once things settle down a little more, we can replace them all relatively quickly."

Ring sits up and looks about the medbay. Johnathan sleeps soundly, the bullet wound in his arm bandaged nicely. Ryo rubs at the bandages where he recieved his head blow. Brooklyn helps the battered Toby Watson back into bed, beside the comatose Setsuko.

"What about Jayce?" It wasn't even a question. She'd been too slow, couldn't gain altitude in time. Dumb bastard put himself in front of her, typical Lenonjayce...

"....Ms Iisaki...she says...her methods can...bring him back...partially. The damage is extensive, but she said there was an 83% of the....procedure..going..." Kusuha begins to wail. "He'll be one of them!! One of those bug-eyed monsters! Why would you let her do that to him?!? He'd rather be dead!"

Ratsel and Sanger watch as Gilliam replays the message again. It must be the 8 or 9th time, but the intelligence agent keeps playing it, looking for subtle nuances, hidden clues, something to help make sense of it.

Yukiko Date sits on her desk, glaring straight at the Camera. "Irregulars, Shadow Mirrors. You should both have found copies of this recording after our battle. I won't bother with pleasantries."

"I created Project SRX under the tutelage of Bian Zoldark, because I beleived in him, and his manifesto against the alien influence affecting our world. I could not follow him on his reckless quest for domination, and eventually it fell to me and my subordinates to end the threat he represented, but I have always held to the core of his message: That mankind alone should influence mankinds destiny. This is why I work within the Federation, because it is there that the greatest threat to mankinds sovreignty can be found."

"The EFA itself is of little concern to us, our agents can nuetralise their conventional forces without firing a shot. But the First, this mysterious race that created the EFA, are subtle, and their true strength hidden. We cannot strike until we can be sure of total victory. You can make that possible."

"I have 48 hours from the time of our assault on your base to confirm its success. If in that time, I do not recieve word from your factions that you will work with us, I will be forced to destroy you. All Irregular and Shadow Mirror targets in our database will be anhilated, and believe me when I say that our list of targets is longer than you think. However, if you cooperate with us, our projected battle strength will be enough to take on even our worst-case scenarios. We can destroy the First and install a proper, human government overseeing this world. The benefits to all of mankind are plain."

The message ends, likely because Date felt nothing else needed to be said. Gilliams finger hovers over the replay button.

Ratsel coughs. "Gilliam...are we going to respond?"

"We've confirmed everyone except Shine and Latooni. Find them, destroy the Zweizergain, and we can be out of this world before her timelimit expires. No, we don't have to send her anything."

"It's what the Shadow Mirrors are going to say, thats what worries me."

Russell devours his plate of stew, gulping it down with the water. Ibis simply flicks her fork through hers, then offers the plate to the still-hungry Irishman. He takes it, but looks curiously at her. She puts her face against the cell wall, feeling the vibrations of the Kurogane.

"48 hours... Do you really think they won't... interrogate us for that long? That they'll let us go if the others agree to help them?"

"I dunno, Douglas. It sounds a bit off, but these EFA jecks, they're meant to be tricksy bastards. Kai said they'd offered him a job, and him a wanted man. Using terrorists ain't so different."

"And when they're done with us? When we beat this other faction for them?"

The silence settles, and is broken again. "What are you doing in Shadow Mirror, anyway?"

Russel shrugs again. "Some gobshite pilot from Belfast Base threw a beer bottle at my head one night. It just sort've... went from there."
