The hulking monstrosity rips itself out of the ground even as it transforms, the red under-mech being slowly consumed by the white plaque spreading across it, turning it into something...else.

I AM WODAN! WODAN YMIR!!! ALL WHO TRESPASS ON THE REALM OF MAGUS...SHALL PERISH!!!

The WildRaubtier settles on its right shoulder, blazing away at the EFA mech in front. "AND I AM KATINA TARASK, THE THUNDEROUS FURY! TODAY, WE STAND AGAINST THESE ENEMIES AS COMRADES!"

It's only now that you notice theres another PT-sized mech on the other, tranformed shoulder, which presently pulls out its own rifle and blazes away at the retreating black Gespenst.

"NONE SHALL ESCAPE!!" The still-changing giant hobbles forward, the drill on its left arm pointed forward like a lance, aimed at the fleeing Cry Wolves unit.

WHAT SHALL KATINA DO?

Shoot the Gespenst as it runs away, after that hit we took to the engine we're in no state to do anything other then lay down fire on him from a distance.

Then contact the guy pilotting the notquite!Thrudgelmir and say "FUCK YES YOU ARE AWESOME AND YOUR MECH IS AWESOME! Your friend isn't bad either."

An arm is blasted off the fleeing Gespenst as it desperately dodges another Drill Boost Knuckle, the limb barely hanging on by another green rope. Another shot takes off half its head. But the thing is fast, and boost skywards, out of range of even your weapons.

Not that you're too worried, with your new friends and all.

"AWESOME! Mr Wodamir, can I just call you Whodes?, you have one seriously twisted mech! Is that a Grungust underneath it? I gotta steal some ideas for the Neo Grungust off you. And you...what the heck is that unit? Oh, we came to rescue Dr. Nate, is she here?"

A girls voice, sounds like someone Latoonis age. "Your friend is heading inside the Cradle to retrieve her. Meanwhile we should see off these EFA scum, don't you think?"

"Sounds like a plan. Hey, Ryuune!"

"Oh god, Katina..."

"Ryuune, shoot that black Gespenst before it gets aw-"

"Katina, get out of there, that's Wodan!"

"Yeah, Wodanamir, he told me that, quite loudly, when he burst out of the ground."

I'm a little leaning towards this as well. Perhaps get off a bit casually maybe there will be some left over that will infect the mech.

At any rate show more concern for Wodan then yourself. Make an impression of being the warrior woman you are and not worrying about something like that.

Unless, of course, someone else could pilot it.

If the Wild ends up being celled, chances are only us could be able to pilot it, so that either leaves:

A wasted Wild on steroids if we keep the Raioh.

Or a wasted Raioh if we switch completely to the Wild.


Of course, we could also have both mechs for situations that require it, but...

That's pretty important to. Not only would you be showing more concern for Wodan over your personal safety (something that would be frowned upon by super robot pilots I would assume) but also it may screw with whatever is happening with Wodan and also injure him.

Also I don't think I've ever heard of Machine Cells not allowing a pilot to use it? Are the basically just to the machine and can still be piloted by anyone?

Jump off from Wodan nimbly mostly without a whole lot of pressure. Place you hand on his head and push it a bit almost like rough play (I hate to make this connection but sort of like how Kenpachi Zaraki and Yachiru do things in Bleach. Just in a super robot fashion. It's how I thought the two would always act, Katina always acting bigger then she actually was)

Don't make a point to brush off the cells on your hand or feet. Obviously they aren't doing anything wrong any they are making you stronger. Leave them strength is power.

The girl who steps down from the cockpit of the Bergelmir is an odd-looking creature, with grey skin, and hair colored in strands of pink and blue. This is neatly mirrored in the complexion of the woman who emerges from the metal rose.

The Shadow Mirrors, and the woman in DC uniform who came aboard, look confused to say the least. Ryuune and Masaki look aghast.

"Ugh...what the heck happened to you?"

The woman steps forward. "I apologise, I must look quite shocking, but integration with the Machine Cells was the only way we could survive the destruction of the Earth Cradle. Only with our bodies altered could be survive in the depths, create...Cynthias Bergelmir, and eventually tunnel our way to the surface to contact you."

Ryuune blinks. "You changed yourselves...wow, and...you're completely in control? Nothings gone rampant or anything?"

"I understand the concern, but frankly, our early experiments with the cells had very little success, and by the time of the bombing we were still having issues getting them to replicate. That they managed to revive us in just a few months is quite a miracle."

"Revive?"

"Cynthia and I were exposed to the cells at the time of the bombing, which left us clinically dead. We only...became active again a few weeks ago."
