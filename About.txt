### Super Robot Wars Quest

#### Once, upon a time
There was a /m/ board on 4chan. And there was a man, called Sciencegar Sciencebolt. And decided he to make a story in Super Robot Wars universe.
About nice group of people called "Shadow Mirror"
With the help of /m/echa

It went surprisingly well.

#### Somewhen in the relative future
I got insane and decided to press SRWQ into something resembling a novel instead of a bunch of reaction posts.
