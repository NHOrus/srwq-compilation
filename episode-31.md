# Episode 08

##SRWQ Mission 31: It's one of THOSE missions.

In our last thread, the climactic encounter at the chinese dig site saw the DC Junkers Faction, the ODE system, the Earths Liberation Front, the mysterious beings known as the First and Only, and the Shadow Mirrors in a massive free-for-all, with our heroine caught in the middle. As she battles, Dumi escapes with the Zweizergain, and Shuu and the rescued humans get lost in the Arabian desert. Meanwhile, back at base, the rest of the Shadow Mirrors scramble to find Dumi, while a new force arrives to challenge them, and show them what the EFA is truly capable of...

Or possibly just provide comedy relief, I'm not sure yet.

Yuuki Jegnan points at the map with a fresh rose. "The plan is simple. We will send the R-0s to buzz the DC base, and get them to deploy their forces in pursuit. They will lead the grunts away, while we engage Groups Gamma and Delta. If the R-0s get in trouble, the Black Knight will assist. Tenzan, Kobayashi, Carla, you handle the Super Robots. I'll take the scout team. Try to remain standoffish, we don't want to use OOC prematurely if we can avoid it. The objective is to suppress, and if we can, capture some mechs. Otherwise, driving them away from the base is the preferred option."

Yuuki downs the last of his coffee, finds a fresh rose, and points at the base. "At this point, Shocker Unit should have secured the Princess. It's a burden, I know, but its a knights duty to royalty. Once she is secure, Shocker will disrupt enemy defenses and prevent them from deploying any more units, while they pull out. Then, we attack their HQ in force, and see how they handle it. Once we reach a stalemate, the Kurogane will come by to pick us up."

Yuuki sniffs his rose, throws it away and picks up another. This one is pinker.

"Any Questions?"

"No questions, But sir, Just how do you keep your hair in that condition?"

"Kobayashi... Why would you of all people ask that?"

Kobayashi-2 strokes her clean scalp. "I...d on't know. I just think you do such a g-good job..."

"So exactly how hard does Carla have you whipped, sir?"

Carla kicks Tenzan in the shins. Yuuki takes another sip of coffee. "Any real questions? Seriously guys, the missions briefings are serious time, not Open Mic Night."

"What if circumstances make retrieval of the princess unwise?"

Yuuki turns to Hongo, leader of Shocker Unit. "Are you doubting your skill, Hongo?"

"Merely clarifying the mission parameters."

"...If you absolutely cannot extract the Princess, you'll have to eliminate her, and anyone she's talked to. But if you do, I'll consider it a grave mark on my personal honor, as well as yours. If your unit is half as skilled as you claim it is, you'll be in and out without anyone even seeing you. Understood?"

"Perfectly."

"Ok. Everyone, prepare to launch!"

---

The Wrench sends a Skeleton-thing flying, as a Lightning Fall incinerates two more. These new beasts are actually a lot easier than the ones you've faced before, but there are a lot of them. And for some reason, their energy blasts are draining the Raiohs reserves.

"Dagnabbit, burn these bastards Raioh!"

Rand swings his wrench in a wide arc to give himself room. "Can't get to Kai... That black mech is laying into him!"

It seems Kai still hasn't worked out the kinks in his custom mech, as already its limbs are stiffening and hydraulic fluid is leaking out. Still, he's managed to disarm Albero, and land several clean hits. The rest of the Cry Wolves are too busy with Bartols to intervene.

You look back as a roar erupts from the ELF camp. Climbing into the sky is a blue mech, Grungust-sized, with a familiar-looking tigers face on its chest. Lightning flashes, clouds gather....

And then it starts raining mountains.

---

Russel Bagman sighs as the Guarlion cruises along "Sure has been quiet while Katina's been gone. Too quiet, nearly. A fella could end up dyin' in bed if it stays like this."

"..."

"Wha's wrong, Latooni? You missin' her as well?"

"Certainly not. I'm merely concerned as to why the DGG-04 appeared without her. It seemed those two were insepar... Contact, behind us. Evade, Bagman!"

"Whu-!" Russel throws the Guarlion into a spin as missiles fly past. He curses as the thing careens through the sky, then switches his sensors.

"What the feck? It's y'on fella from the Irregulars, the buck that was forever going on about stuff. Why is he shooting at us??"

The voice that comes over the comms isn't Arado's friend. "Well done avoiding my first attack, its nice to see you have at least some skill. Now, let us move on to the true fight! Arm yourselves, whelps!" The R-Wing boosts after the two, G-cannons blazing.

"Lat, get out of here! Head to Dumi, I'll slow this bastard down!" Russel swings the Guarlion around, autocannon blazing, but none of the shots land.

"Roger." Latooni doesn't even look back as she accelerates towards the target point.

"Splitting up?" Yuuki grins as Russel charges in with his assault blade. "You obviously think highly of yourself... Lets see if you meet expectations."

The assault blade stabs into the spot were the R-wing was, as the machine transform upside-down and gracefully draws its revolvers mid-flip. The bullets bounce off the back of the Guarlions head as Russel desperately rolls away.

"Not terrible, but not so great either."

"Shurrup, ye nonce!" Russel hits the accelerator and boosts away, the Guarlion starting to glow blue.

"Oh dear, a Sonic Breaker... You're a poor excuse for a knight, having no unique style of your own..." The R-1s fists begin to glow pink as Yuuki draws them together.

"I...  said... SHUT UP!!!" The Guarlion rockets at the other mech, which makes no attempt to dodge.

"T-Link Blade, show this fool a true knight's power!"

The pink flash clears and Russel finds himself piloting half a Guarlion. And not the half with a Tesla Drive either...

---

Latooni suppresses a shudder as Russel transponder goes offline. I knew it... Man wasn't anything of a pilot anyway. "Trilobite 1, please come in, we are under attack."

"This is Trilobite 1, we are also engaged. They're bombing the base, the DC are deploying Lions. It looks like the units we fought in the Gulf of Mexico."

Project SRW... Kai's mystery faction, and the backers of the School. Stands to reason we wouldn't find any friends there.

Latooni then notices a new contact on her scope. A big one, and headed in the same direction as her. What now?

---

The Hi-Zol Launcher gouges a long trough in the side of the XN-Giest, and Tandem-4s legs melt from under him. The rest of Tandem brigade take to the air, only for glowing Strike Shields to tear into their ranks like bloodthirsty hawks.

"Ride, Trombe!!" Ratsel skates along the jungle floor, exchanging fire with the R-Gun. Dygenguar takes to the air after the R-3. Gilliam grimaces. This is exactly what I wanted to avoid, a high-level conflict like this could cripple us!

"Colossal Spinner!!" Sanger lets his blade fly as he dodges Strike Shields. "Gilliam, do the rest!" The Dygenguar boosts downwards, drawing its second blade.

"Alright!" Otherworldly energy flies up into the air, curving around the Tandem Brigade members and bracketing the R3, which just manages to dodge the giant blade. One shot comes perilously close to the R3, only for a strike shield to intercept it, fading into nothingness.

"N-no!" The R-3 draws its laser cannon and begins blazing away at the giant Giest. "I won't fall into blackness!"

"Aya, please! This fight is pointless!"

"Notmyname notmyname NOTMYNAME!!"

Power couplings and armor plates pop off under the precise fire, but Gilliam stand his ground, slowly maneuvering the R3 into just the right spot...

"B-behind..." The R3 spins on its axis and holds out an arm, and a green glow surrounds the massive spinning sword. It slows to a crawl a scant few meters from the R3, and stops.

Then Tandem Brigade are on top of her.

---

"A foolish error, sir! Once I'll happily exploit!" Tenzan raises his cannon and fires full-force into the falling Dygenguar. There is contact, and a massive burst of energy.

"Fool! You didn't have to die h... What!??"

"Dygenguar won't fall to the likes of that!!" Charred but still intact, the massive robot completes its strike, tearing a gouge in the R2s chest as the artillery mech desperately leaps backwards.

"Agh!! Suicidal idiot!!" The Beam Chakram snakes out and grazes the DGGs shoulder, but then, something unexpected happens.

Sanger catches the Chakrams string.

"You're not going anywhere, Tenzan Nakajima, not till we have a word with you!"

---

The jungle about them is torn to shreds, the ground cratered, but Ratsel and Carla are pausing only long enough to reload.

"Yuuki, these guys are good, real good! Aya and Tenzan are both damaged, and they're taking everything we're giving them."

"Acknowledged. I've caught a small fish, it'll have to do. Pull out, now!"

"Right!" Dodging cannon shots from Ratsel, Yuuki boosts skyward, and fires her main guns straight down, throwing up a cloud of debris about the Aussenseiter. Tenzan jettisons the Beam Chakram and boosts away. Kobayashi groans as the R3's TK field goes to full strength. Popping flares and turning ECM to full, the three head to the rendevous point.

Sanger picks up the Type-3 Blade. "Gilliam, is it worth pursuing them?"

"The Zweizergain signal is close, and still not moving. I'm not sure we can take the risk..."

---

The StealthRaubtier transforms and lands near the unusual transport. "Dumi, where are you?"

*Here... Apologies for the lack of signal, I'm just... not handling this new body very well.*

"I see, you're in the transport. Where's Tarask?"

*Northeast China. Long story.*

"Alright. The Zweizergain is intact?"

*Yes, and I think I can move now... Although I'm picking up more units coming after you, and I don't think they're friendly.*

Latooni checks her radar, and see the Giest and the DGGs closing in. "Quite a powerful force... How fast can that new body go, Dumi?"

*My systems should be optimal again in a minute or two, but by then, they'll be within firing range. And they're between us and the base.*

"So it's touch and go..." Latooni smiles a little to herself.

---

Gilliam looks into the arcane device that functions as the Giests dimensional scanner. "The Zweizergain's definitely in that odd ship... Which seems to be dimensionally active itself! Is this some new Shadow Mirror device?"

Ratsel shouts a warning. "Incoming aircraft!!" Beam blasts spack off the Giests armor as Latooni flies in, dodging and weaving the shots of Tandem Brigade, and an exploratory shot from Ratsel that comes worryingly close.

Gilliam grimaces. "This ones just trying to slow us down! Use suppressive fire, and get after that transport."

Dumi hits the thrusters and begins to circle around the Irregulars. It is indeed going to be close...

---

With the Lions heavily engaged with the R0s and 4 new units on the way, the Shadow Mirrors blast off to join the fight. Rio watches them leave, and prays they'll all return safely.

She sighs, then heads over to the rear of the hangar to prepare the emergency repair equipment. "Ryo, gimme a hand with the crahs webbing, will you?"

"Okurghh..."

"Ryo?"

Rio jogs to the coolant tank where she heard her partner. She peeps around the side, to see if he's banged his head or something.

The sight of the figure standing over Ryoto's unconsious body almost makes her swoon.

Rio backs off, fumbling for her gun. "Wh-who are you? What did you do to Ryo? H-help, Johnathan!"

The helmeted... or is that his head?... figure leaps forward, its gloves... no, those are hands!... crackling with energy. Rio ducks back into a defensive stance, realising that if the gloves hit her, the fight will be over.

She blocks a sudden strike with her gun arm. The limb goes numb with the impact, and the weapon drops away. The thing is too strong...

---

*Tis, theres something you should know.**

"What? I'm busy, I have to help Dumi!"

*Theres someone in the ship, Tis. He's walking through the lab, he's investigating the W-series. Wait, theres another. That ones heading into the medical bay.*

"Oh, fudgsicles..."

*Calm down Tis. Whats the status of W-BC-1s repair?*

"The Machine Cells were at 83% when I last checked..."

*That should be enough. Go, W-BC-1. Protect Katina's friend, she won't forgive me if I let them die.*

*What about the other me?*

*We'll cross that bridge later. For now, act.*

---

The cyborg thing dives back as the spanner flies past its head. Simultaneously, Johnathan Kazahara strike the alarm button.

The second cyborg coldcocks the engineer from behind. He stumbles into a storage crate, and the thing energizes its hands.

Rios hands wrap around the gun again. 10 seconds of frantic combat have left her aching, and her grip on the gun shakes as the first cyborg turns back to her.

Three bullets strike the cyborg right between the eyes. The light pistol rounds barely leave dents. The things hand wraps around Rios wrist, and for a moment, it feels like she's on fire. Then, blankness...

---

Kusuha starts awake at the sound of the alarm and the scream. She blearily looks about her, taking some seconds to realize she's in the nurse office, having knocked herself out with a bottle of shandy. Well, it was either that or listen to that whiny girl tied up on the bed.

The cyborg breaks in the door, brandishing a dartgun.

---

The black pod tears itself open and the front hatch flies into the cyborgs face, making it drop W-MP-179s pod. The thing turns to face the new arrival.

"So... Dr. Fehu's experiments made it to the next stage, I see..."

Ryo Murasame cocks his head at the thing in front of him. Externally, it doesn't look like a cyborg, but internal scans show differently. Definitely one of the prototypes... and it had been upgraded, more than once.

Ryo would grin if he still had a mouth. "I thought all this stuff looked familiar. You Shadow Mirrors are ripping off the good doctors wo-"

The punch sends Version-ZX right into far wall, splattering open another w-series pod. The thing that was once Arado Balanga draws back its fist, then glances to the side as it hears a scream from the next room.
