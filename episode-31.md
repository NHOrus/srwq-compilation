# Episode 08

##SRWQ Mission 31: It's one of THOSE missions.

In our last thread, the climactic encounter at the chinese dig site saw the DC Junkers Faction, the ODE system, the Earths Liberation Front, the mysterious beings known as the First and Only, and the Shadow Mirrors in a massive free-for-all, with our heroine caught in the middle. As she battles, Dumi escapes with the Zweizergain, and Shuu and the rescued humans get lost in the Arabian desert. Meanwhile, back at base, the rest of the Shadow Mirrors scramble to find Dumi, while a new force arrives to challenge them, and show them what the EFA is truly capable of...

Or possibly just provide comedy relief, I'm not sure yet.

---

Yuuki Jegnan points at the map with a fresh rose. "The plan is simple. We will send the R-0s to buzz the DC base, and get them to deploy their forces in pursuit. They will lead the grunts away, while we engage Groups Gamma and Delta. If the R-0s get in trouble, the Black Knight will assist. Tenzan, Kobayashi, Carla, you handle the Super Robots. I'll take the scout team. Try to remain standoffish, we don't want to use OOC prematurely if we can avoid it. The objective is to suppress, and if we can, capture some mechs. Otherwise, driving them away from the base is the preferred option."

Yuuki downs the last of his coffee, finds a fresh rose, and points at the base. "At this point, Shocker Unit should have secured the Princess. It's a burden, I know, but its a knights duty to royalty. Once she is secure, Shocker will disrupt enemy defenses and prevent them from deploying any more units, while they pull out. Then, we attack their HQ in force, and see how they handle it. Once we reach a stalemate, the Kurogane will come by to pick us up."

Yuuki sniffs his rose, throws it away and picks up another. This one is pinker.

"Any Questions?"

"No questions, But sir, Just how do you keep your hair in that condition?"

"Kobayashi... Why would you of all people ask that?"

Kobayashi-2 strokes her clean scalp. "I...d on't know. I just think you do such a g-good job..."

"So exactly how hard does Carla have you whipped, sir?"

Carla kicks Tenzan in the shins. Yuuki takes another sip of coffee. "Any real questions? Seriously guys, the missions briefings are serious time, not Open Mic Night."

"What if circumstances make retrieval of the princess unwise?"

Yuuki turns to Hongo, leader of Shocker Unit. "Are you doubting your skill, Hongo?"

"Merely clarifying the mission parameters."

"...If you absolutely cannot extract the Princess, you'll have to eliminate her, and anyone she's talked to. But if you do, I'll consider it a grave mark on my personal honor, as well as yours. If your unit is half as skilled as you claim it is, you'll be in and out without anyone even seeing you. Understood?"

"Perfectly."

"Ok. Everyone, prepare to launch!"

---

The Wrench sends a Skeleton-thing flying, as a Lightning Fall incinerates two more. These new beasts are actually a lot easier than the ones you've faced before, but there are a lot of them. And for some reason, their energy blasts are draining the Raiohs reserves.

"Dagnabbit, burn these bastards Raioh!"

Rand swings his wrench in a wide arc to give himself room. "Can't get to Kai... That black mech is laying into him!"

It seems Kai still hasn't worked out the kinks in his custom mech, as already its limbs are stiffening and hydraulic fluid is leaking out. Still, he's managed to disarm Albero, and land several clean hits. The rest of the Cry Wolves are too busy with Bartols to intervene.

You look back as a roar erupts from the ELF camp. Climbing into the sky is a blue mech, Grungust-sized, with a familiar-looking tigers face on its chest. Lightning flashes, clouds gather....

And then it starts raining mountains.

Russel Bagman sighs as the Guarlion cruises along "Sure has been quiet while Katina's been gone. Too quiet, nearly. A fella could end up dyin' in bed if it stays like this."

"..."

"Wha's wrong, Latooni? You missin' her as well?"

"Certainly not. I'm merely concerned as to why the DGG-04 appeared without her. It seemed those two were inseper...Contact, behind us. Evade, Bagman!"

"Whu-!" Russel throws the Guarlion into a spin as missiles fly past. He curses as the thing careens through the sky, then switches his sensors.

"What the feck? It's y'on fella from the Irregulars, the buck that was forever going on about stuff. Why is he shooting at us??"

The voice that comes over the comms isn't Arado's friend. "Well done avoiding my first attack, its nice to see you have at least some skill. Now, let us move on to the true fight! Arm yourselves, whelps!" The R-Wing boosts after the two, G-cannons blazing.

WHAT WILL RUSSEL AND LATOONI DO?

Adding in to the whole, "Recruit everyone" problem.

I think we could do with some more "enemy base" cutscenes or stuff like we did/are doing with Yuuki.

The reason i think plenty of people just want to recruit everyone is because they feel it is the only way the characters will appear regulary.

"Lat, get out of here! Head to Dumi, I'll slow this bastard down!" Russel swings the Guarlion around, autocannon blazing, but none of the shots land.

"Roger." Latooni doesn't even look back as she accelerates towards the target point.

"Splitting up?" Yuuki grins as Russel charges in with his assault blade. "You obviously think highly of yourself...Lets see if you meet expectations."

The assault blade stabs into the spot were the R-wing was, as the machine transform upside-down and gracefully draws its revolvers mid-flip. The bullets bounce off the back of the Guarlions head as Russel desperately rolls away.

"Not terrible, but not so great either."

"Shurrup, ye nonce!" Russel hits the accelerator and boosts away, the Guarlion starting to glow blue.

"Oh dear, a Sonic Breaker...You're a poor excuse for a knight, having no unique style of your own..." The R-1s fists begin to glow pink as Yuuki draws them together.

"I...said...SHUT UP!!!" The Guarlion rockets at the other mech, which makes no attempt to dodge.

"T-Link Blade, show this fool a true knight's power!"

The pink flash clears and Russel finds himself piloting half a Guarlion. And not the half with a Tesla Drive either...

Latooni supresses a shudder as Russel transponder goes offline. I knew it...Man wasn't anything of a pilot anyway. "Trilobite 1, please come in, we are under attack."

"This is Trilobite 1, we are also engaged. They're bombing the base, the DC are deploying Lions. It looks like the units we fought in the Gulf of Mexico."

Project SRW...Kai's mystery faction, and the backers of the School. Stands to reason we wouldn't find any friends there.

Latooni then notices a new contact on her scope. A big one, and headed in the same direction as her. What now?
The Hi-Zol Launcher gouges a long trough in the side of the XN-Giest, and Tandem-4s legs melt from under him. The rest of Tandem brigade take to the air, only for glowing Strike Shields to tear into their ranks like bloodthirsty hawks.

"Ride, Trombe!!" Ratsel skates along the jungle floor, exchanging fire with the R-Gun. Dygenguar takes to the air after the R-3. Gilliam grimaces. This is exactly what I wanted to avoid, a high-level conflict like this could cripple us!

WHAT WILL GILLIAM, SANGER, RATSEL, AND THE REMAINING OG GRUNTS DO?

That's why I suggested to have a full-scale attack on the base that ends up killing lots of characters and destroying awesome mechs.

Have Gilliam deploy on his Gespent and go help out Lat.

Sanger should use the colossal spinner and then rush the enemy with the smaller General Blade. This is a bluff. Control her movements with the Dygenguar until she is in a position where the boomerang colossal blade ends up pinning her in it's return.

Have Ratsel jump toward the R-Gun while shooting rapid-fire shots at her. Then when back on ground, rush at the distracted R-Gun and shoot it point blank.

I doubt Katina will show up in this fight.

The Zweizergain and the Granzon already teleported somewhere else, and Katina is still very busy fighting the Einst.

There won't be a reunion since god knows when. But still, Rand and Katina travelling across the globe stirring chaos on the EFA as they go while trying to reach our allies, only to find the whole base destroyed and all of the forces scattered across the world, not giving a shit about conquering or saving the world.

Then it's up to Katina to put everyone back in shape.

Anyone here hopes we become faithfull to our name and become as dangerous as a tarask?


>It is hoped that the tarask is a solitary creation, some hideous abomination unleashed by the dark arts or by elder, forgotten gods to punish all of nature. The elemental nature of the tarask leads the few living tarask experts to speculate that the elemental princes of evil have something to do with its existence. In any case, the location of the tarrask remains a mystery, as it rarely leaves witnesses in its wake, and nature quickly grows over all remnants of its presence. It is rumored that the tarask is responsible for the extinction of one ancient civilization, for the records of their last days spoke of a "great reptilian punisher sent by the gods to end the world.

Alright, let's all stop for a minute. It's become clear that we need to rework how we do things if we want to get anywhere with any of our plans.

First, we need to decide what we want. What do we prioritize above everything else at the moment, in terms of character arcs, in terms of mechs, in terms of getting ourselves established instead of just running around doing whatever crap Sciencegar can come up with?

Here's what I prioritize.

Relationships: I want to develop our relationships with Lat and Ibis, to get settled with Kai, and to find a way to help out Dumi/get Dumi out from under Dark Brain's thumb. I want to see if we can gather the Aggressors and get Magus on our side. All others are secondary - we don't have a chance with anyone but Lat or Ibis, or a one-night stand with Lamia. We cannot rape everyone. The sooner we come to terms with this, the sooner we will be able to actually progress in the relationships we have.

Mechanics: I want us to find a means of producing and reliably repairing some mechs. For this, I want to take our Zfylud Crystal samples that we got from Judecca and get them to Magus so that they can be used to refine the Machine Cells. Once we have the Machine Cells in their full form, we'll be able to do something about the EFA, which right now we can only hinder but never kill.

Long-Term Goals: I want to help Kai start his war, set our enemies against one another, defeat the Einst, do something about Keisar Ephes, and then face off against Dark Brain in the biggest, baddest motherfucking war in the history of ever.

That's what I want. What do the rest of you want?

Relationships: establish close relationships with core people. People that will prove useful when we need them the most. I am talking about Dumi, Shuu, the agressors etc. People of big names and mechs + a lil bit of harem crazyness on everyone else.

Mechs: make the few mechs we have broken. Find ways to unite all the different techs we have into one gigantic clusterfuck that ends with us having several mechs on par with the Neo Granzon. I don't care much about numbers, seeing those get trashed easily and then end up with us having to waste precious time repairing those.

Long term goals: defeat the network of evil that spans the entire SRW multiverse. Become a saviour.

Relationships: Obviously Dumi is OTP. Lat, Ibis and Arado should be secondary priority. Kai, Shuu, Ring and Lamia should be on friendly terms with.#

Silly goals along the way: Give Axel amnesia, get him hooked up with Lamia. Force Arado to crossdress. Go slightly psycho when W#!Arado wakes up.

Long term goals: Either form a splinter faction or seize control of the Shadow Mirror for ourselves. Free Dumi from Dark Brain. Wipe out both factions of the EFA and declare ourselves the rulers of our new world.

Super long term goals that aren't going to happen:: Find a way to become a god.

Also, I'd like to address the issue of betrayals and trust. We have found so far that it's been difficult to trust anyone completely, because very few people are working in our interest. The way we go about our dealings must change. People cannot be trusted to work in our best interests, but they -can- be trusted to work in accordance with their personal motivations. If we work in accordance with those motivations, or if our motivations coincide with theirs, we can trust them to whatever extent this applies. A perfect example is Dumi - we can trust Dumi perfectly because we know exactly what motivates Dumi, and at exactly what point we can stop trusting it to work with us. We know what motivates Kai, and so we can trust him because his goal is our goal.

I trust the following:
-Kai, to work towards dragging the EFA's cold war into the open.
-Dumi, to work in our best interest as much as it can, but it -must- place seeking the mech Dark Brain wants it to find before that.
-Latooni, to work with us if we can provide her the chance to exercise her skill in the face of risk that she craves.
-Ibis, to do whatever we ask if she can be convinced that Sleigh would want her to or that it will help her find Sleigh.
-Irm, Russel, Echidna, Lamia and Bullet, to play along with just about anything as long as we don't go batshit.
-Axel, to be a prick but a helpful one.
-The EFA, all of it, to take any opportunity to beat the shit out of us. We have to convince the First and Only that they want to beat the shit out of the SRX Team more than they do us, and vice-versa, if we want to succeed here.

Quoted By: >>4619775

I want to ascertain the motivations of:
-Magus, who I -think- is on our side but likely needs further convincing. Giving her the Zfylud Crystals she needs will likely help in this, as well as demonstrating that we don't just want the Cells for personal gain. She needs to feel in control of that particular situation for us to enter/remain in her good graces.
-Any other Aggressors we meet. Right now that's just Kar-Wai and Rand, I think. We want to know where they stand and if they'll help us help Kai. All of them are some of the best pilots available to us, we want the full set all in custom mechs if possible.

I absolutely don't trust:
-Van Trat and the DC. We need to take what we can from them, but then break away if possible. Even if this means losing access to Aguija, it's worth it not to be reliant on someone we cannot in any way guarantee the loyalty of.
-Vindel Mauser. For now, he's our commander, and I certainly don't want him or Zweizergain as an enemy, but I must stress that if possible we should be prepared to break away from him if necessary.

To degrees. Ring is mostly trustworthy. Shuu is trustworthy for now, but an eye must be kept on him simply due to precedent. So far, however, he seems like one of our most valuable allies in terms of sheer utility, and I would like to keep him on our team.

The OG Numbers are trustworthy in that we know their motivation - find and destroy Zweizergain, then probably get out. For now, this means our goals coincide, but since Zweizergain has just been found, the OG Numbers may soon become a rogue element. We must use caution in relying upon them for anything.

"Colossal Spinner!!" Sanger lets his blade fly as he dodges Strike Shields. "Gilliam, do the rest!" The Dygenguar boosts downwards, drawing its second blade.

"Alright!" Otherworldly energy flies up into the air, curving around the Tandem Brigade members and bracketting the R3, which just manages to dodge the giant blade. One shot comes perilously close to the R3, only for a strike shield to intercept it, fading into nothingness.

"N-no!" The R-3 draws its laser cannon and begins blazing away at the giant Giest. "I won't fall into blackness!"

"Aya, please! This fight is pointless!"

Power couplings and armor plates pop off under the precise fire, but Gilliam stand his group, slowly manuvering the R3 into just the right spot...

The jungle about them is torn to shreds, the ground cratered, but Ratsel and Carla are pausing only long enough to reload.

"Yuuki, these guys are good, real good! Aya and Tenzan are both damaged, and they're taking everything we're giving them."

"Acknowledged. I've caught a small fish, it'll have to do. Pull out, now!"

"Right!" Dodging cannon shots from Ratsel, Yuuki boosts skyward, and fires her main guns straight down, throwing up a cloud of debris about the Aussenseiter. Tenzan jettisons the Beam Chakram and boosts away. Kobayashi groans as the R3's TK field goes to full strength. Popping flares and turning ECM to full, the three head to the rendevous point.

Sanger picks up the Type-3 Blade. "Gilliam, is it worth pursuing them?"

"The Zweizergain signal is close, and still not moving. I'm not sure we can take the risk..."

WHAT WILL THE OG GUYS DO?

Regroup and send Ratsel to scout the area near Zweizergain. When we are sure that there aren't any other enemies nearby send some more people to claim the Zweizergain.

The StealthRaubtier transforms and lands near the unusual transport. "Dumi, where are you?"

Here...Apologies for the lack of signal, I'm just...not handling this new body very well.

"I see, you're in the transport. Where's Tarask?"

Northeast China. Long story.

"Alright. The Zweizergain is intact?"

Yes, and I think I can move now...Although I'm picking up more units coming after you, and I don't think they're friendly.

Latooni checks her radar, and see the Giest and the DGGs closing in. "Quite a powerful force...How fast can that new body go, Dumi?"

My systems should be optimal again in a minute or two, but by then, they'll be within firing range. And they're between us and the base.

"So it's touch and go..." Latooni smiles a little to herself.

WHAT WILL LAT AND DUMI DO?

Charge. There's no way Zengar can hit Lat in the StealthRaubiter, so have her distract Ratsel and buy Dumi some time. Once Dumi's recovered, charge straight for the base full throttle.

Also, have Dumi call Tis to help cover us with the Belgermir.

Gilliam looks into the arcane device that functions as the Giests dimensional scanner. "The Zweizergain's definitely in that odd ship...Which seems to be dimensionally active itself! Is this some new Shadow Mirror device?"

Ratsel shouts a warning. "Incoming aircraft!!" Beam blasts spack off the Giests armor as Latooni flies in, dodging and weaving the shots of Tandem Brigade, and an exploratory shot from Ratsel that comes worryingly close.

Gilliam grimaces. "This ones just trying to slow us down! Use suppressive fire, and get after that transport."

Dumi hits the thrusters and begins to circle around the Irregulars. It is indeed going to be close...

Generally, I agree with damn near all of your conjecture, though I'm personally leaning toward some of the more reasonable indulgences from Thread 29/30's big checklist. Operation STREAKER is an obvious no-go, but anything that gets us befriending Dumi, Latooni, Ibis, and at least one Arado is cool in my book.

With the Lions heavily engaged with the R0s and 4 new units on the way, the Shadow Mirrors blast off to join the fight. Rio watches them leave, and prays they'll all return safely.

She sighs, then heads over to the rear of the hangar to prepare the emergency repair equipment. "Ryo, gimme a hand with the crahs webbing, will you?"

"Okurghh..."

"Ryo?"

Rio jogs to the coolant tank where she heard her partner. She peeps around the side, to see if he's banged his head or something.

The sight of the figure standing over Ryoto's unconsious body almost makes her swoon.

WHAT WILL RIO DO? Johnathan Kazahara should be in the hangar, and there are other engineers around...at least there should be....Come to think of it, Rio hasn't seen many in the last few minutes...

Rio backs off, fumbling for her gun. "Wh-who are you? What did you do to Ryo? H-help, Johnathan!"

The helmeted...or is that his head?..figure leaps forward, its gloves....no, those are hands!...crackling with energy. Rio ducks back into a defensive stance, realising that if the gloves hit her, the fight will be over.

She blocks a sudden strike with her gunarm. The limb goes numb with the impact, and the weapon drops away. The thing is too strong...


Tis, theres something you should know.

"What? I'm busy, I have to help Dumi!"

Theres someone in the ship, Tis. He's walking through the lab, he's investigating the W-series. Wait, theres another. That ones heading into the medical bay.

"Oh, fudgsicles..."

The cyborg thing dives back as the spanner flies past its head. Simulataneously, Johnathan Kazahara strike the alarm button.

The second cyborg coldcocks the engineer from behind. He stumbles into a storage crate, and the thing energises its hands.

Rios hands wrap around the gun again. 10 seconds of frantic combat have left her aching, and her grip on the gun shakes as the first cyborg turns back to her.

Three bullets strike the cyborg right between the eyes. The light pistol rounds barely leave dents. The things hand wraps around Rios wrist, and for a moment, it feels like she's on fire. Then, blankness...
Kusuha starts awake at the sound of the alarm and the scream. She blearily looks about her, taking some seconds to realise she's in the nurse office, having knocked herself out with a bottle of shandy. Well, it was either that or listen to that whiny girl tied up on the bed.

The cyborg breaks in the door, brandishing a dartgun.
The black pod tears itself open and the front hatch flies into the cyborgs face, making it drop W-MP-179s pod. The thing turns to face the new arrival.

"So....Dr. Fehu's experiments made it to the next stage, I see..."

Ryo Murasame cocks his head at the thing in front of him. Externally, it doesn't look like a cyborg, but internal scans show differently. Definitely one of the prototypes...and it had been upgraded, more than once.

Ryo would grin if he still had a mouth. "I thought all this stuff looked familiar. You Shadow Mirrors are ripping off the good doctors wo-"

The punch sends Version-ZX right into far wall, splattering open another w-series pod. The thing that was once Arado Balanga draws back its fist, then glances to the side as it hears a scream from the next room.
