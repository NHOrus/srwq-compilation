# Episode 14

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 14: You people will be the death of me.

You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask. Your groups attempt to invade the OGverse was cut painfully short when the heroes of the OGverse counter-invaded to prevent the entity Dark Brain from destroying them. In the confusion, you and a small group of Shadow Mirrors escaped with some experimental super robots and a prisoner, Arado, who dredged up memories of his Shadow Mirror counterpart for you. After allying with the DC and agreeing by proxy to track down Vindel Mauser and his Zweizergrain, the source of all this trouble.

Through many battles, the surviving Shadow Mirrors have gathered in a hideaway in Brasilia to lick their wounds and figure out what to do next.

In the lull, you have decided to drag a group of both Shadow Mirrors and shaky OG allies to the city for the Mardi Gras.

This can't possibligh end badly.

---

You get to the bar and see that the others have settled in already. Ibis is talking with some of the locals and showing them a piece of paper, Ring and Russel are in a relatively quiet corner, and Kusuha is at the bar, negotiating loudly with the barman.

"Is there a problem, Nurse Mizuha?"

"No no, I'm just explaining my order to the barman."

The barman puts down a large glass tumbler and pours out a measure of vodka, one of gin, one of rum and two of scotch, tosses in a lemon and handed it to a suddenly quite eager Kusuha.

"It's my patent-pending health drink. Wanna try one?"

The feeling of drinking this mixture is as if you were deepthroating someone whos dick was on fire. You can just about manage large sips, and you're no lightwieght. Kusuha drains a quarter of the large glass in one go.

"It *kaff* wakes you up, at least."

"I know! Great stuff!!"

"Let's head over to the others."

You sit at the table next to Ring and Russel. Ibis is still at the other end of the bar, flashing what appears to be a photograph at the locals while nursing a coke. Ring is having the local wine, while Russel is attacking a good old-fashioned Guinness.

"So, where were you?"

"Seeing Arado off. So, whats the agenda for tonight?"

Ring sips at her drink. "So, I'll admit I've only caught a little of what's happening with the Shadow Mirrors. Can you fill me in?"

Russel looks like he's about to talk, but you begin before him. "Well, we were planning to use some wierd technology to move into another dimension, get out from under the EFA and rebuild on another world, but we attracted the wrong sort of attention. The people from the other world distrupted our transport and sent their mechs in, saying that if we used it it'd lead some monster or something to destroy their universe."

"...Wow. Ugh, that puts me a little out of my depth. I'm just a pilot, engineer, and businesswoman, interdimensional warfare is a little out of my league."

"Once you focus on the important details its not that weird. Anyway, the EFA started attacking the newcomers, so they had to ask the DC to help them find Colonel Mauser, who has the dimension jumping technology. We were sheltering with the DC so we decided the best thing was to find the Colonel, and then see what to do then."

"So the threat of these guys is so great you'd sell out your own leader to them?"

"Well, Arado is one of them, so maybe not...."

---

"Um, Has-o visto esta mujer-o?"

"Nós falam o espanhol aqui, senhorita, nós falamos portugese. "

"I looky for this woman-ski, you see-see?"

You drag Ibis away from the confused bystander and hand her a glass of health drink. "This is not search-for-Sleigh time. This is drinky time."

Ibis absent-mindedly takes a sip and bursts out coughing. "Oh god, what is this stuff?"

"It's a health drink. It's been prescribed by a real nurse. Now sit down." You plop down across from Ring again. She still seems bewildered.

"Wait, so the four who went across the other way, they're from another dimension, like ours but different in little ways."

"Yup, they joined us because they need to find the Zweizergain more than they hate us."

Russel looks confused. "I thought one of them was crew from the other Trilobite."

"Eh, not important right now. But Ring, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be swimming in a giant pool of money on the moon?"

"The Moon Cradle is practically run by the EFA since they recaptured it from the aliens. I was sidelined and basically made a puppet while they started development on the next wave of Gespensts. Between that and all the horror stories being circulated about the EFAs inner workings, I decided I was better out of that place. So when Shuu showed up asking to look at our Black Hole Engine, I stole it and the three of us went underground to build his dream."

"Wait, Three? I thought it was just you and Dr. Shuu?"

"Oh... dammit that's right, we left Jayce in the Tausendfuessler, outside of the base! I really should have invited him along, he's been skulking in there for days! Agh, such an idiot!"

"Jayce?"

"Lenonjayce, one of my old pals from PTX. I suppose he'll have to make do with meeting Irm, if the old lug can tear himself away from that viper Kai..."

"Wait, you've got something against Kai?"

"The Agressors and PTX were rivals, remember? Our S-types versus their R-type Gespensts, and they won, hard, even with my company backing us. But Kai was the worst of them, working all sorts of backroom deals and undercutting us in subtle ways. Man should have been a politician, not a pilot."

"Mmm, ats'nice." You polish off your second 'health drink'. "Gonna check on Dumi, back in a sec."

Russel cocks and eyebrow "Are y'sure? Tisn't like the big fella will get nicked or anything."

"'ll be fine. Need air anyway."

You walk mostly straight out to the main street, where you find Dumi covered in cast-off bits of festival regalia, greatly adding to his disguise.

*Hello Katina. You appear to be inebriated.*

"'m fine. What's going on out here?"

*The citywide celebrations are still proceeding apace. It's quite the spectacle to my sensors.*

"Wha'bout the others?"

*The girl called Seolla has finally calmed down, and she and Arado are enjoying the concert, while speaking to Rio and Ryoto about their universe. It appears that they know the counterparts to many of our fellows, although only some of them came in the newcomer group.*

"Huh. S'interesting."

*I realise this may not be the best time to ask this, Katina...But have you given major thought to what you're doing with this group?*

You plop down on a bollard and start to ramble. "Well... where else would I go? The Shadow Mirrors are my friends, the only people I've ever known who'd really give me a chance to be me. I can barely remember life before the School, and those old farts at the School just think I'm a defect. The Mirrors have seen the worst I can do, and will still let me go with them. Besides, the idea of a world of fighting forever... I can get behind that."

*I see... but are you going to get that, the way things are going?*

"I... I don't get what you mean."

*Look at where things are going, Katina. The Shadow Mirrors are shattered as a group, and in order to survive in the long run, they're going to have to give up their best mechs and their top leaders. The lives of Vindel Mauser and Lemon Browning are forfeit to the Irregulars, as is Axel's, because his attachment to Lemon will not allow him to let her die. The top surviving Shadow Mirror after this is either Echidna or Irm, neither of whom are truly cut out for command. In all likelihood, the group will fall under the sway of Captain Kai, who has an as-yet unknown agenda. And all this assumes the fighting to come will not destroy the group. The EFA's response to the crisis has been haphazard so far, but will escalate exponentially in the coming days and weeks. The chances of them finding and targetting us are quite high.*

*The perfect life of eternal war may not be feasible right now.*

"Well then, what do you suggest?"

*I think the group needs a new direction. The conflict here on Earth is pointless, we will at best be bit players in the struggle between dimensions. Once its over, we will probably not be any better off.*

*Our best chance to not only survive, but to prosper, is to leave the conflict behind completely and find new pastures. And currently, the only place to do that is in space.*

"What, just up sticks and leave?"

*The Trilobites have the ability, they can make orbit with minimal chance of detection and be out of the Earth Sphere in a few days. The group could hide among the colonies, or better yet, at a farflung location like Jupiter where the EFA would not have the resources to pursue us. There, we could rebuild the Shadow Mirror, or something similar.*

"Hurm....maybe that wouldn't be the worst idea ever..."

*I don't think they build AIs specifically to come up with the worst ideas ever.*

"Maybe we should ask that cool Shuu guy to help! His mech can teleport a whole bunch of stuff at once, maybe it'll reach to space!"

*That does present some intruiging tactical possibilities if it is true. However, I'm not sure Dr. Shirakawa can be completely relied on.*

"What makes you say that?"

*From scanning my archives, it appears the man is a cypher of the highest order. He has worked with basically every faction on the planet for almost a decade, the EFA, EOTI, DC, multiple scientific institutions and engineering companies. He's abandoned each one in mysterious circumstances, sometimes leaving scattered notes on his theories in twisted recompense for stealing information or cash. And now that I've actually met the man, he doesn't present the kind of demeanour needed to justify such actions.*

"Ugh...how so?"

*Well, primarily, I am unimpressed by his grandstanding over his great 'plan', which he seems to be incredibly vague on the details of. I suspect either it's of a contraversial nature he cannot reveal to us, or he actually doesn't have a real plan at all.*

"Y've given me a fair bit to think about, Dumi, but if I stay out here much longer, I'll sober up. I'll catch ya in the morning maybe, and see what we can do then."

*Very well. Enjoy the rest of your festivities.*

---

You re-enter the bar, and, after checking your wallet, realise you have just enough to buy a round of 'health drinks' for the table. Thank God for universal currency.

Ibis shakily takes hers, Ring politely sips, Russel gives his a swig. Kusuha knocks back the half of one she had and starts on the fresh one.

Ring looks concerned. "Uh, Kusuha, isn't that, like, your fifth."

"Sum'n like'at."

"Honey, theres five shots of liquor in each one! How are you still sitting straight?"

"Old drunks trick, takin'he corner seat." Kusuha does not look very well.

"R'ssel, I got'he last round, s'y'r turn."

"Katina, lass, I t'ink maybe you've had enough."

"Mebbe... mebbe... but the ussers hasn't. 'Ey need some."

Kusuha perks up. "Yeh, Ursel, g'v's anuvver."

"Well you've definitely had enough."

"Go on, onegaaaaiii."

"No, I think you two should call it a night. Maybe we all should, its getting late and we do still have work to do. We'll gather everyone up and head back."

You dance merrily down the street, arm in arm with Kusuha, singing incoherently in different languages, with Ibis on your other arm, not drunk enough to join in but not sober enough to pull away. You meet up at the truck as Ring brings the others from the concert. Seolla and Arado are arm-in-arm, and Ryuune and Rio have picked up garlands of flowers along the way.

Arado nods nervously as you approach. "W-well Katina, did you have a good nWHAT ARE YOU DOING TO KUSUHA??"

"I'm loos'nin' her shirt, she needs air."

"You're unhooking her bra!"

"Her boobs need air too."

Kusuhas only response is a giggle and the word 'oppai'.

Seolla punched Arado in the head to make him stop looking.

Seolla herds Arado into the front seats, while you and Kusuha flop into the back of the truck in a giggling pile. Ryuune, Rio, Ryoto, Ibis and Russel enter with you, with Russel reaching over to remove your hand from the depths of Kusuha's blouse.

"Now now, don't be at that carry-on! That's harassment, that is."

"She do'mind, do you Kusuha?"

You don't have nearly enough japanese to make out here mumbling.

"See?"

Russel throws his coat over her to preserve her dignity. Ryuune looks disturbed at your antics, Ryoto is torn between disapproval and boobs, and Rio seems to find the whole situation hilarious. Ibis sits down beside you and Kusuha, looking at her photograph with a melancholy expression on her face.

You put an arm around both Ibis and Kusuha and grin over at Ryoto.

"Hey, Ryo, how many women are you going home with tonight? I've got two."

"Urm...Ugh...You shouldn't be saying things like that, Ms Tarask."

You uncross your legs. "You could make it three if you play your cards right."

Ryoto turns bright red and begins to stammer incoherently. Rio is practically doubled over with laughter.

"I-I-I have a job to do!! I have to help rebuild the Shadow Mirror, just like you do! N-No time for pointless fraternisation!" Ryoto crosses his arms and turns his nose up, trying to take the moral high ground.

Ryuune whispers to Russel. "How long was the trip back again?"

"Two hours."

"Damn."

"Well, if you're not going to take advantage of the good on this side of the truck," You say as you cuddle up to a semi-conscious Kusuha and a slightly irritated Ibis, "Then maybe you'll be partaking in the facilities on your own side."

Ryoto nearly jumps out of his skin, and looks at Ryuune on one sode of him, and Rio on the other. Ryuunes glare quickly makes him turn his back on her, while Rio continues laughing, but in a different way.

"Wow, Ryoto, you chose an odd time to ask a girl out."

"I-I-I'm not doing anything like that! I just...y'know....There's nothing wrong with you or anything....I'd certainly take you over anyone on that side...I I I don't mean I want to take you in that sense, I er I er Its just that um-"

"You're just too easy, Ryoto. Katina can barely sit up straight and she's got you wrapped around her finger. You shouldn't let women like that have the run of you."

"Er um yeah. Tha-thanks, Rio."

Ensign Mickey sits up in his sleeping bag and watches as the missing crewmen arrive back in the missing truck, many of them obviously inebriated, several of the girls having to be carried back into the hangars, one raving that they "gotta lock the lovebirds in the same room".

"And here we were worried they'd gone AWOL. Damned pilots, thinking they run the Shadow Mirror."

Feeling tension in his bladder, Mickey gets up and walks a short distance out of the camp to take a piss. As he waters one of the trees he muses about his future. "Can't go back to England anyway, not with terrorism charges over my head. Wish the brass would decide what we're going to do next, if we're really going to rebuild, or just hide. All this uncertainty makes a soldier nervous."

"Agreed. Perhaps we can make things clearer together."

Mickey whips around to face the barrel of a gun pointing at his face. Behind the gun is a slight figure in camo gear, but with the arms and legs of a red flightsuit poking out.

He can't be certain with all the facepaint, but it looks like he's just been captured by a 13-year-old girl.

"There are some very important people who would like to have a chat with you, Mister. They will be very pleased to here from you. I know this."

"Seriously, Ms Hamill, how long are you going to keep us here?" Vindel Mausers voice has its usual polite but determined tone, impressive considering he could barely stand up a day ago.

Manami Hamill continues to sit calmly in front of her guests, pouring out tea for herself. "Well, there is still the matter of your health to consider, you did take quite the shock to your systems..."

Lemon smiles a humorless smile over her cup. "That might apply to Vindel, but not to me, as your doctors will no doubt attest. Yet I am under the same compulsion to stay in this quite lavish but still restrictive bunker."

Lady Hamill sighs and puts down her cup. "If you wish me to be more frank, then I shall. And frankly, we can't let you two out of our sight. First, theres the matter of security, as if the two most infamous terrorists on the planet are seen in this area, you'll bring the EFA down on our heads. Secondly, there are internal issues."

"And in, you don't want your own people to know we're here."

"More than a few blame your withdrawal of military and financial support for our recent disastrous losses."

Lemon smiles. "I sense a 'thirdly' coming on..."

"Well, Miss Browning, quite simply, we want to know what's going on ourselves before we buy into your rather far-fetched story of dimensional travel and invaders from another earth. The Earths Liberation Front is independent from the Shadow Mirrors now, by your own word, and we will act like it. We will decide how to proceed, and whether you still count as our allies, given all thats happened."

Vindel bows his head. "Very well. I admire your straightforward tongue, Ms Hamill, its a rare commodity in this half-dead, shrivelled-up world. And, to be honest, staying hidden for a while was something we intended to do. We have to plan for how to proceed from here."

"Very well. I shall leave you to your wargames, and attend to our other guests..."

Did they? I know they already fought the Inspectors, but I think that was all.

we can unite all the fronts if they attack us, except the EFA but to hell with them.
and that is exploitable if we go the terrorist way. you know the character is an evil psycho and we have plenty of toys.

And Dark Brain is still out there. Who knows what it's up to. Does it know the OG folks want to deny him access to their world?

Whatever the end game is, it'll be full of aliens, terrorists, and lots and lots of mechs.

Yes, but unless it's some more of the things OGs changed, I don't recall any indication that the SM verse had fought the actual Zovorg alliance proper, just the Inspectors, same as OG verse.

Brooklyn Luckfield brings his fist down on the table. "You can't leave us locked in here, lady! We need to rejoin our friends, we've told you why!!"

Hamill keeps her arms crossed as she faced the two otherworlders. "Yes, we've gone over your story enough times. It's quite the tale, if Mauser weren't saying something similar but slightly different I would have thought you mad. But I'm not here to reiterate all of that, I want to move on to your machine."

Kusuha blinks. "R-ryukooh? What do you want with it? It won't work for just anyone you know!"

"You needn't tell us that, that much was obvious from a cursory glance. Or did you think you were the only ones with experience with such things?"

Bullet and Kusuha look at each other, then back at Manami.

"Tell me, do you know a Dr. Eri Anzai? And have you ever been to her archeological site in China?"

The expressions on the two otherworlders faces was all the answer Hamill needed.

"W-wait, what are you planning? Are you really going to use the ancient machines?"

Hamill turns to leave. "The Earth is in the grip of dark forces, under the shackles of the EFA. We'll need great machines like yours if we ever hope to free the Earth."

"You can't...that's not what Ryukooh's purpose is!"

"Desperate times, Miss Mizuha. Once we've secured our own version of that machine, we will attempt to make contact with your friends. And then you and your Dragon-Tiger can fulfill whatever purpose you wish."

Bullet and Kusuhas protests are heard only by the shutting door.

Good luck to her.
Unless they have people with pure intentions to pilot the machine beasts then they may as well be lumps of iron.

So if they want a working Ryukuoh of their own they need phychodrivers that want to protect earth, not ones with stupid agendas. At least this means we wont ever have to deal with a SM Shine in them, that would be a pretty fucked up fight.

If you drug them a lot, yeah. Not as effective, though.

Then again, Son Ganlon. That sort of reasoning probably wouldn't work on the Four Gods, but the Chokijin CAN betray Earth...assuming they team up with Gebel. Probably not happening yet.

The Chokijin may not be exactly the same as their OG counterparts, just to point out.

Also, someone being a Psychodriver in OGverse doesn't mean their SM version will be one, and vice versa.

This would be incredibly cool.

But who would pilot those?

Before you ask, I think that Yuuki and Carla should definetly NOT be the pilots. They are not cool enough.

Actually, they wouldn't be able to make a bipedal mech at all. The two of them would just take their Beast forms and stay that way.

...that makes no goddamn sense. They can combine the beast forms just fine without absorbing any mechs, it just depends how healthy they are. They combined in Alpha without mixing with a Grungust until later.

They're magic super robots. They can do whatever the fuck they want.

This is a problem.....or maybe.....?

What if the four Choukijin were alive in this world, and all four combined with the Trailer's vehicles?

The Hawk Choukijin combines with the Valhawk.

The Turtle wth the Valstork.

The Tiger with Arm Arcus.

And the Dragon with the Arm Stora?

Remember, they aren't exactly healthy. In OG1 they needed to absorb a 50 meter tall super robot to replace key systems, such as cockpits.
