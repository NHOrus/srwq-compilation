## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 21: Now we can get drunk for reals 

When last we left our brave adventurers, they had just retrieved Dr. Sophia Nate and her Machine-Cell infected fellows from the Earth Cradle, while seeing off the attentions of the Cry Wolves. In the battle, Katina discovered that the Cry Wolves leader was some kind of organic monster, and interrogated former Cry Wolves leader Kai Kitamura. He revealed the two-fold conspiracy in the EFAs upper echelon, the bio-aliens of the Council of the First and Only, and the hyper-secretive, high-tech School-trained warriors of Project SRX. Kai explained that the only hope for the Shadow Mirror world was to start a civil war between the two sides, and the only people who could do this were the Irregulars from the OG Universe... 

---

Irm grimaces. "So, we just hand in our favor to Van Vat Tran, ask him to falsify the Dimensional Scanner results, and send the Irregulars, who're supposed to be our allies, into the deathtrap of Geneva, full of unkillable alien monstrosities? That's the plan?"

Kai nods. "I know it doesn't sound like a very nice thing to do, but its the only way we're going to fix our world. With most of the Shadow Mirrors gone, the ELF on its last legs and the DC basically being kept alive as an excuse for all the military funding, the EFA has to go, or at least change massively."

"It just doesn't feel...right to be messing with them like this. And theres the danger that they'll figure out what we're doing."

You break in through the tension. "Look, why don't we at least see what the alien scanner says first? Thay way, if we can detect Vindel with it, we'll know where he is, and we'll have a few spots to point to that we can say to the Irregulars 'Hey, its over there!' Then we can go on ourselves and find the Colonel while they 'eliminate' the other options."

Irm looks at you, then nods. "I'll agree to hold off on a desicion until we see what the results are." 

---

"Sorry sir, but Vat Tran's in a meeting right now."

Irm looks genuinely angry at this. "What? We're the ones who found those scientists for him, the least he can do is let us sit in on the meeting!"

"I'm sorry sir, I have my orders. Vat Tran explicitly said this was a DC matter."

Irm looks like he's about to protest some more, but then grunts and turns to you. "Well, guess we're stuck for a while. I'll wait here for Vat Tran to show his face. You... I dunno, I'm sure you can find something to do."

You grin slightly. 

"But keep what we discussed on the quiet, we haven't made any decisions yet so its best to keep everything under wraps, even from the others."


---

It's now after midnight, and you only caught a quick cat-nap since the events in Brazil, so you head to your bunk to get yourself fresh for the morning.

Your rest is willed with odd dreams, of metal men and tentacle monsters, some terrifying, some strangely erotic...

You awake to the sound of a battle alert.

"ALL HANDS TO BATTLE STATIONS!! INCOMING ENEMY FORCES!!!"

You race to the hangar and find most of the crew already deploying. Arado flies out on the repaired Guarlion, with Kai in his new Gespenst following him. You see the StealthRaubtier, prepped and ready, with Jayce Starlord arguing with the techs about it. The Rai-Oh stands at the back of the ship, its arms and legs still half-dissassembled. Nearby, the Bergelmir starts up, and begins walking to the hatch.

Then the sky lights up, and a massive shudder passes through the world. You and almost everyone else are knocked to the floor, equipment flying everywhere. The Bergelmir stumbles against the wall of the ship.

You hurriedly pick yourself up off the floor of the Trilobite and rush towards the black Raubtier, as Jayce gets to his feet.

"Hey! I called dibs!"

"Being in the pilot seat trumps dibs." You flick on all the preflight checks, and the systems boot up quickly. The Machine Cells have been making tweaks, it seems.

"So what am I meant to be piloting? Or do you want me to sit here playing Tetris while you guys fight?"

"That's been working out great for you so far."

"Thanks for reminding me..."

You reach for the final ignition switch.

*There is another way, Katina.*

"Dumi?"

*Cynthia, do you have some of those Machine Cells available right now?*

The Bergelmir turns to face the giant motorcycle. "Ugh, yeah, The Bergelmir stores a small amount of backup Cells. Why?"

*Katina, I'm detecting a Space Noah class vessel and multiple extremely powerful mecha being launched from it. A Raubtier isn't enough firepower to make a big difference in a battle like that. But if we use the Machine Cells to repair the RaiOh, we may stand a better chance.*

"Are you sure that's a great idea, Dumi? It did quite a number on the Grungust Type-3, after all. The effect is cool and all, but I don't want Rai-Oh to mutate."

*I'll monitor the Machine Cells, and try to ensure they retain the Raiohs original form. I have the full schematics, so I should be able to program them to do repair rather than full transformation.*

"Ugh....damn, this decision was a lot easier to make when it was just theoretical..."

"Dammit, Katina!" Jayce hops up beside the cockpit of the Raubtier. "Either launch in this damned thing or get out of it!"

"But...using Raioh means using technology that could fuck me in the ass! Literally, if it turns Raioh into a tentacle monster or something..."

"You think I didn't catch that part? Ring and Shuu have been jawing about that stuff all fucking morning. And, dangerous as it might be, they both said they would like to test it out."

"Really? Even Ring?"

"Ring made the goddamned Huckebien, Kat. A black hole on legs. We made two of them, and one of them went nuts and killed a lot of our friends. But she didn't give up on it: She found Shuu, and together they fixed it. The new Huckebien EX is out there right now, fighting your goddamn fight for you! Thats how real scientists do their jobs. Now, either take off, or get the fuck out of that cockpit!"

"Alright, take the damned Raubtier! Dumi, Cynthia, do your thing!"

The Bergelmir nods, and a hatch opens in its chest, from which it takes a sphere of grey goo. It places the blob next to the Raioh, and it begins to move, pseudopods extending to pick up discarded parts and flow into the gaps in its frame.

---

Irm's Gespenst stops a bit away from the fallen Granzon. The mighty robot is immobile in the crater it landed in, glowing with heat. "Shuu! What the heck happened!?"

"Urgh....I detected a high energy buildup from the Haganes bow, consistent with Tronium Discharge, so I attempted to use the Granzons portal generation abilities to deflect the weapon. It was 97.8% successful, but the remaining energy was still enough to overload my power couplings. I fear the Granzon will not be of much use in this fight."

"Well, you stopped them from wiping out the base in one shot, so I guess you did a good job."

"Perhaps, but....do you have the firepower to deal with that?"

A dozen Gespensts Customs fly down out of the mighty EFA battleship, heralding the Cry Wolves return to the fray. Just behind them, come three unusual mecha, including a super robot, and on either flank, a large grey unit.

"Giganspadas! They're really not fucking around this time!" 

The forces of the DC scramble, as over three dozen Lions and a dozen Barrellions, covering their flagships and the detachment of Landlions rolling out of the bunkers. The Rhino begin exchanging fire with the Hagane, and the area around their deployment zone becomes a raging inferno under the EFA ships guns.

---

The air is thick with fire from both sides. The main engagement is directly over the base, as the Cry Wolves engage the main DC forces. Keeping in tight professional formation, the 13 silent mechs lay into the Lions with a vengeance. Several are armed with melee weapons, and concentrate on swatting the DC forces out of the air, the others use their F2W cannons, shooting the Lions in their way, then firing fullpower blasts at the Barrellions below. The casualties are horrendous, but three of the Gespents are knocked out of the sky in the first minute of fighting: One to a lucky Barrellion hit, one to a crashing Lion, and one to the Photon Beam on Vat Trans Rhino.

"Hold on guys!!" The StealthRaubtier boosts through the gunfire as Jayce catches up to the main fight. The PTX veteran sees Russel and Arado dueling with the Black Gespenst. 

Russel strains as the Command Wolf tries to drive its plasma stakes into his torso, but just about manages to hold the stronger mech off with leverage. Then Arado drives his assault blade into the black mechs face.

"You bastards! We could have settled this peaceful...huh?!??" Arado is taken aback as the gooey contents of the Gespensts head spray onto his mech, including what looks disturbingly like an eyeball.

"No, we really couldn't." The black mech boosts backward and swings Russels Gespenst into the Guarlion, sending both mechs sprawling.

---

"Star Team, Glory formation! Take down that artillery unit!"

"Roger!"

"Yokai... I mean Roger!"

Giganspada 1 comes under a torrent of fire, as beams, missiles and bullets slam into it. It's a veritable storm of fire, and one of the giant cannons crumples under the onslaught, but that's not the weapon that's charging...

Meanwhile, Lamia sends three arrows and a burst of shadow lances at the second, which jam in it main body, and knock it off target.

Both mechs fire wide, disperse beams of energy. The first takes out 4 Landlions and cuts through several important buildings, the second thankfully only melts tarmac.

The 2 Gigans turn away from their bombardment targets, and turn on their attackers... 

---

"Kai, what is that thing?" Irm shouts as he dodges fire from three flying machine-gun pods

"Tsentr Project Unit 6, codename Cerberus. Part of a failed attempt to produce mechs without fusion or black hole reactors."

"So it's one of those units that shouldn't exist, then."

"Convenient when you need it to kill someone on the sly, isn't it?"

Kai's improved output gets him past the pods, and he charges at the Cerberus, as it charges up its main cannon. At the last moment, it boosts away from his Jet Magnum, throwing the shot off, and it passes well over the Angelgs head.

"Ma...jor..."

"Oh god, I don't need this..."

"Major... Kill me..."

"Dammit, Aqua, I was going to do that anyway, now you're just making it harder!" 

---

"Go down!" Ibis fires off the Schutzwalds beam cannons at the black mech, but the thing rolls out of the way and fires an oversized beam rifle at her, forcing emergency evasion.

"OHOHOHOHOHO!!!" The mech rapidfires, driving Ibis back through several buildings as it tears up the ground, the middle-aged woman at the controls chortling all the while.

The beams strike the black mech in both arms and the head, knocking off large chunks of armor and making it drop the rifle. Latooni lines up the bitgun, and puts a beam right through the Divided Rifle, smashing it to shards.

"A simple target..."

"You! You hurt my baby!"

"What?" Ibis groans as she drags the Schutzwald out of the disused hangar it crashed into.

The swords pop out of the black mechs arms, and begin to glow with otherworldly light. "My precious children... will kill you all." 

---

The Fang Knuckles grab a Landlion and tear it in two before returning to the giant robot, and the things turns to face its opponents, as missiles burst across its armor.

Echidna raises an inquisitive eyebrow as the thing shrugs off her assault. "Engineer, is this a Grungust-type?"

Johnathan blips in over the comm. "It has design features from the Grungust Type 2, but its different in most areas. I'd say they used some of our spare parts to build the frame, but the power source and motive system... I couldn't even begin to tell you where they got them."

"Acknowledged. I'll have to collect combat data for you then."

But the Garmraid seeks bigger prey, and launches itself at the white mech coming into the fray. It leaps at the Thrugelmir and the buzzsaw in its knee digs into the white mechs arm, but then its backhanded a good 50 meters back. 

"I am Wodan Ymir, the Sword of Magus. My mistress forbids your passage!" With a wrench of metal, the left drill is torn off the Thrudgelmirs back, and send flying at the Garmraid with the right Boost Knuckle. The drill makes a hellish noise as it strikes the red mech in the shoulder, trashing a fang knuckle. 

The pilots only response is a scream of rage, and the fists of the Garmraid light up with his fury... 

---

Sean Webley wets his lips as the Hagane poured fire onto the DC battleships. One, still damages from yesterdays battle, succumbs to the bombardment and explodes, showering much of the base in shrapnel. Just a few minutes, and this whole nest of traitors will be nothing but a black spot on the dirt.

"Admiral, enemy unit approaching! Vairose class!!" The main screen zoomed in on the Vaisaga as it cut the arms off a Cry Wolf and charged for the battleship.

"It's an evasive type, use spread fire! Don't let it close!"

AAA and missiles shot at Brooklyn, passing through after-images, bouncing off his blade, and one or two actually marring his armor, but they didn't slow his advance. Bursting through the ships shield, he dug his blade into the armor of one of the turret and wrenched it upwards, bisecting the gun. 

"He's too close! Detonate blister mine 6!"

Just behind the Vaisaga, a raised portion of armor pops out of the hull and detonates, showering the entire area in shrapnel. The Vaisaga lurches from the blow, and takes a missile to the chest.

"We have him..."

"Sir, second contact, coming from above!!"

"What?! How did it gain altitude that quickly? Identify it!"

"Sir... its the Vanishing Trooper!!!"

The red Huckebien swings around the oversized cannon and locks it into the reactor port on its chest. The air around it turns purple as it slip easily past walls of flak and waves of missiles.

"This is Ring Mao, first firing test of the Neo Black Hole Cannon. Let's see what this baby can do!"

The sphere of absolute darkness punches straight through the battleship and out the other side, pulling a dozen hull blocks and the port launch catapult with it, before a good 10% of the Hagane dissappears into nowhere in a flash of purple.

"...Not bad."

    TURN 1 COMPLETE. ORDERS FOR NEXT TURN. 

---

Arado and Russel pull out of their deathdive and pull up, as Kai boosts over a Terminus Cannon shot that drills a trough through the concrete below. As he looks up to see the two, he also sees what's coming behind them.

"...You two! Stop that girl. I'll handle him." With that, he boosts straight at the Black Gespenst, dodging beams as he goes, and makes a grab for the black mech, which it dodges by a few feet.

The black mech does a reverse flip, and comes back up to face Kai. "I know that one, the lead-in to the Jet Magnum S, right, Kai?"

Kai sets his jaw. "Albero Est is dead."

"Yeah, I am. That hasn't stopped me, as you can see."

"You're not him, you're just one of those green-blooded monsters with his voice."

Albero laughs a cold laugh. "Probably. But, regardless, you're overdue for a killing, and...well, the bosses changed our motto, Kai."

"Did they now?"

"Yeah. Now, it's 'Don't come back if any are left alive'." 

"Cute."

The two mechs charge at each other.

 Irm grunts as shells rip up the left side of his Gespenst. "Slash Rippers! Cut them down!"

The remote-control blades reach out and cut two of the drone pods from the air, while the third is crushed by a Jet Magnum. Irm pauses, then leans over: Sleigh's bright red Gespesnt is in bad shape.

"Ibis'll kill me..."
The Coating Sword stabs straight for Arados cockpit, but Russel interposes himself and blocks with his plasma stakes, entangling the blade. "Nows yer chance lad!"

"Right!" The Guarlion boosts for hieght, and flies through the melee, glowing blue as the Breaker Field charges up. As Russels plasma stakes begin to melt from the strain, he impacts the Cerberus dead centre, shattering the Coating Sword and sending the unit flying.

It lands on its feet, trips and rolls over, then tumbles into a crouch, with its railgun drawn. The first round takes the left hand off the Guarlion.

"Cross Smasher!"

The Cerberus' right arm and Terminus Cannon shatter to fragments as the red and blue streamers of energy eat away at it. Deprived of weapons, it falls silent.

 As the burning fist strikes home, the Thrudgelmir goes flying backward, straight through the DC command centre and into the Lion hangars beyond. Tons of concrete and twisted metal fly through the air like dust motes. Then the white mech picks itself up. The shattered left arm begins to ooze back together, as the Drill Boost Knuckle reattached to the right.

"Unless your attacks slay me in one hit....THEY ARE USELESS!!!"

The Thrudgelmirs eyes burst with Green flame. "EYESLIT STORM!!!" Two bursts of green energy lance out and strike the Garmraid's recharging fist, blasting clean through and severing fingers. 

Then, with a roar, the Thrudgelmirs chest opens like a dragons maw.

"OMEGA DISASTER!!!"

The line of white energy bursts across the base, carving a furrow deeper than any of the enemy fire has created so far. IWith that tornado of destruction flies the Garmraid, its bulky form crashing down on one of the perimeter watchtowers. It looks distinctly crispy, yet still manages to pick itself up.
Van Vat Tran grimaces as he see the destruction being wrought. "Hmmph, it looks like your bodyguard is going to tear my base apart trying to cover our retreat."

Dr. Nate frowns. "That's irrelevant. With the Machine Cell at your disposal, you can create any number of bases, at your discretion, far better guarded than this one. Right now, the priority is our security."

The semi-tonal voice of Aquija cuts in. "Yes, you should be no stranger to cutting and running by this stage, Vatran."

Vat Tran grimaces. "Well, the Haganes stopped firing, so we have our chance. Helmsman, get us to the coast ASAP, we'll meet up with the Killer Whale, and see if this Wodan fellow leaves us anything to work with."

 The two coating swords dance around the Soldifar like a fretful partner, as Latooni desperately battles to keep the Medius from chopping her in half. The ramblings of the woman inside it aren't help her concentration.

"No!! Aqua, my precious daughter! They've beheaded you, dismembered you, defiled you! I'll never forgive them!"

"Please....be quiet."

Blocking the two swords with her good hand, Latooni fires her beam machinegun into the Medius' stomach with the other. Chunks of torso fly off, but then black mechs leg comes up and kicks the gun away.

"Murderers! Sneak-theives! My family will be avenged!! OHOOHOHOHOOHHOHO!!"

Latooni ducks just in time to avoid losing the Soldifars head, as Ibis boost into the fray, both autocannons rattling away. The Medius backs off as the shells burst off it.

"Uwwaaaargh!! I...I must...Oh god, were am I...gotta run..."

"Going somewhere?" The Cybuster flies down from the melee and stabs its blade into the heart of the black mess.

"ARRRGHH!! ALL IN ONE! FIRST AND ONLY!!"

The tentacles burst from the wound, and wrap around Cybusters arms.

Exactly. That whole incident was rigged and it would have worked just fine if it wasn't for the inspectors.

Every other time it wasn't rigged the whole thing worked out.

Just look at the Tronium Cannon. Untested in actual battle but saved the OGs asses when they stormed the DC base.

Or the HTB cannon that wasn't tested properly but worked just fine when the SRX had to fend of the Einsts.

Or the R-1 when it was first deployed. It was still very unstable but ended up saving Ryuse's ass when they needed it most.

Or the DGGs when they were first introduced.

Sure, some of them had issues at first but then they got over it.

 Admiral Webley waves away the damage report and turns to his comms officer. "Where the hell are the Giganspadas? They're supposed to be guarding our flanks!!"

"Giganspada 1 is heavily engaged, cannot respond! Giganspada 2, breaking off!!"

The grey unit swings away from the Angelg, spewing missiles as it goes, and turns towards the red blur that is the Huckebien. Once more the Wide Blaster starts to charge up, set to bathe an entire sector of sky in unavoidable energy.

"Not today!!" Battered but unbloodied by the missiles, the Angelg lands on top of the Giganspada and rams its blade into the cannons assembly. Yellow flame starts to pour from the gun, and as Lamia pulls away, bursts out, engulfing Spada 2, which begins to spiral towards the ground.
Missiles fly everywhere as Spada 1 fights off the DCs newest units, and fails miserably. The best it can do is to beat on the Armorlion, which has little trouble taking it.

"Damn, this sonuvabitch is taking it like a porn star! I'm nearly out of ammo here!"

"Can it, Star-2. Star-3, use the Sabers to bring it down!"

"Ok! Sonic Sabers!" Breaker Fields form around the main engines of the Altairlion, and Star-3 swings them at the damaged port cannons. Sure enough the blade-shaped field force the thick plating apart, and expose the inner workings of the unit. 

"Right! Square Cluster!!" Nearly a hundred micro-missiles stream from the Armorlion's shoulders into Spada 1s internal workings, and set them aflame. Spada 1 joins its brother in a deathspiral.

"Hah! Too easy!"

"T-Toby! Watch out!!!"

And then the monsters are upon them.

I am not trying to start a discusion like that.

I just wanted to say that we can't do shit about all those conspiracies and talks behind our backs, and whatever happens, happens.

We don't need to break unnnecesary sweat for events that can't be stopped. Did any of us constantly worry about the Shadow Mirrors joining with the Inspectors in OG2 with all the talking behind the shadows they did there?

I don't think so. We just had to deal with that problem when it eventually happened.

 Jayce finishes his half-loop and comes up behind the Cry Wolf, blasting it in the back with beam cannon and missiles. The Tesla Drive fails and the Gespenst is sent to the ground, where half its fellows are already lying.

But to even stop that few, the DC have paid a terrible cost. There are but a handful of Lions left, and the remainder are in retreat. The Cry Wolves fall on the Barrellions, and begin beating them down, the vunerable artillery units being no match for the enhanced Jet Magnums.

Jayce swings around, trying to find a fight he can actually help to win, and spots three Cry Wolves attacking the Star Team. But these Cry Wolves seem different: Already heavily damaged in the intense fighting, they've sprouted some kind of claws, and weapons from internal bay of no known configuration. The Vegalion takes a hit and begins to tumble, head over heel.

"I'm sick of these bastards and their endless bags of tricks!" The Raubtier transforms and grabs a Gespenst from behind, yanking it off the Altairlion. The pilot thanks him by drawing its G-drivers and putting a dozen rounds into the thing, which shudders and finally falls down.

"Good work! Now we've gotta-"

"TOBY!!!" The Altairlion transforms and dives after the falling red AM.

"-finish them off."

 "Barrel warp within limits...lets try her again!!" Ring reattaches the Black Hole Cannon, and once again, the air around her turns purple as reality prepares to vomit itself inside out.

"Admiral, its preparing to attack again!!!"

"Goddamned insect...Prepare manuver Delta-3! Watch for the peak gravity distortion...."

A sphere forms inside the cannon and launches itself down the barrel, towards the Haganes rear.

"NOW!!!"

The Hagane's leftmost engines fire together on full boost, wrenching the massive ship around to face the Huckebien head-on, as the sphere of destruction passes harmlessly through the sky before dissipating.

Sean grabs desperately to his command chair to avoid being thrown to the floor. "Fire! Fire Everything!!"

Beams, bullets and missiles fly at the red mech, and Ring throws it into full boost simply to avoid the stream of destruction. Something twangs off one of the rear wings, as she curses herself for managing to miss a battleship...


Brooklyn pulls out of his dive and land on the tarmac, next to the fresh furrow thats been dug through the base. He turns to face the advancing Garmraid, as it picks up speed again.

"Well, I've broken my lance on the main prize...lets see what the other contestants are like!"

The Vaisaga leaps forward, cutting into the Garmraids flank, and drawing something like blood. But then Brooklyn dances backward to avoid a massive fist, and raises his blade to deflect a forehead beam. "It seems theres still fight in you! Excellent!! It's a duel!!"

 "Are you getting all this, Director?"

"Yes, the StealthFalkens image-gathering abilities are excellent, as expected."

"Good, because for a moment, I wasn't sure I could beleive my eyes."

Kirk Hamill ignores the Black Knights jibe and bends over to whisper to Director Date. "This is the clearest video evidence yet of the Councils use of alien biomatter."

"I'm well aware."

"This could be the big break we need. We can bring this to the EFA top bras-"

"None of whom we can be certain are untainted. The Sleeper Agent theory is still too dangerous to ignore while the alien genome is so difficult to detect. Anyway, evidence of the intrusion is not the most important thing here. It's them."

"The Irregulars?"

"This is a concentration of firepower unheard of outside of our own base. It's taking on the Hagane and more than holding its own. This group could end up being very useful...if they survive."

The Black Knight speaks up again. "Any further orders, Director?"

"No. Continue observation until I say so. The next few minutes may be critical.

kill em all, there will be no escape, rip and tear etc.
focus on designated targets and run em down, stop shooting/slash/kick/punch unless the pilots are absolutely sure there is nothing left. the hagane would make a good start but there is more dangerous shit running around.

Has anyone else ever wondered if Kirk Hamill is related to Manami Hamill?

If they are, things could get interesting, considering Manami has the Zweizergain, the Koryuoh and is going after the KRO's SMverse counterparts...

 Hmm we're kicking ass but at the same time the DC have taken a serious beating. I doubt we'll be able to take down the Hagane this battle and EFA reinforcements will probably show up soon so I suggest we start pulling back gradually.

These guys are kicking our asses. I doubt rushing them aggressively will do much.

But then again, we have to get our asses kicked before the Raioh appears so whatever.

What this man said: Keep doing what they are doing right now.

And perphaps you could make Bullet do a High-speed rush to cut as much Hagane-turrets as he can.

Okay. Have Kai continue to engage Albero. Irm, Arado, Russel and Jayce should move to cover Star Team. If we can at least pummel the Gespents enough to begin a regen cycle we can regain the initiative. Hugo seems entirely focused on Wodan and Bullet, so he's taken care of.

With Sean focusing all his fire on Ring, he should be open, and the Rathgrith can shove F-Solid shells up its engine block. Have Lamia join in. 

Restraining the Cybuster has to be a full-round action at least, so have Ibis, Lat, and Ryunne pummel Elvy until she can't afford to keep him pinned. Take different angles so she can't use him as a shield.

Actually, melee is the best range when faced with a barrage of fire, as the fire angles mean less turrets can shoot the same target.

Why not? The explosions can't be enough to damage the inside of the ship in any significant way, or they wouldn't even have the things. And they would be be designed so that frag only goes outwards, not in towards actually hitting the bridge or anything.

Well, I can understand them being on armoured areas of the hull, but the bridge area is significantly weaker due to the necessity of windows to see out of. Placing mines near there sounds daft to me. 
SEED D Cagalli !!U5xc0wG3iH0 Sat 20 Feb 2010 08:34:12 No.4559558 Report 
 The mines are specifically designed to blast outward. Damage to the Hagane would actually be quite minimal, especially if it was primarly a shrapnel/fragmentation type mine, which it seems to be.

If we're going to attack the bridge, we need to safeguard that area first by attacking the hell out of it in the hopes we might prematurely detonate the mines.

If push comes to shove and it's a matter of defeat or victory, I am all for attacking the Hagane's bridge. But let's not do anything hasty just yet.

Unrelated, but why do they need windows to see outside? Why even have the bridge in such a dangerous place?

Can't they just place the bridge in the center of the ship or something and use cameras as their eyes? I mean, that's the more logical thing to do, not to mention you can place cameras everywhere and not be limited by the window.
