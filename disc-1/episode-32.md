# Episode 32

##SRWQ Mission 32: ATTAKU RAIDO: BALANGA

In our last terrible thread, we left Katina battling Einst, EFA, DC Bartols, the Earth Liberation Front, Vindel Mauser and the Ryukooh, and switched back to the DC base in darkest Africa, where the SRX team of Yuuki, Carla, Tenzan and Aya had assaulted the rest of the Shadow Mirrors to learn more about them. As mechs battled desperately around the DC base, a secret team of cyborgs infiltrated the Shadow Mirrors ship to steal equipment and capture personnel. And the only person who can stop them is a teenage boy that our heroine killed herself...

---

Unit-ST raises the dartgun at the screaming nurse, one eye on the victim, another on their primary target. Shine Hausen looked at the cyborg with relief, then over his shoulder with concern. The thing was had been Jo Shigeru risks a look behind it.

Unit ZX smashes into his face, sending his stun dart astray and the gun out of his hand. The two cyborgs pick themselves up as The Boosted Child steps through the shattered doorway. He nods at Kusuha.

"Don't mind me, I'm just a passing-through abomination against god."

Kusuha faints. The two cyborgs leap at the boy-thing.

Arado catches both cyborgs in mid-leap, and slams them to the ground, squeezing at their necks until he hear popping noises. "You've done a good job, Dumi. This new body... it's all an undead monster could ask for!"

*I do try my best. And its not like I haven't made improved humans before.*

"More than improved, transcended! I'll be like a g-" The two booted feet strike Arado in the back simultaneously, sending him flying with artificial force. He lands next to the restrained girl in the red jumpsuit, and the unconscious guard beside her. With a hiss, the damaged cyborgs switch to backup oxygen supplies, and charge again. The bulkier one is headed for the boy, crackling with electricity, while ZX heads towards the restrained girl, knife in one hand, grenade in the other.

Arado leaps off the floor and grabs the large cyborg. Lightning courses through him, but he is beyond pain. He twists, and the cyborg flies into his partner.

"I don't know why they want you, girl, but I don't intend to let them get you."

Shine strains against her bonds. "N-no! My future is with them! Let me goooo!!"

She yells as Arado picks up the entire bed, ripping it from the floor supports, and uses it as a battering ram to smash down the door, and escape into the hangar. Outside, Arado sees two more cyborgs, carrying off three unconscious forms, and firing back at armed crewmen as they head for the exit.

WHAT SHALL OUR HERO-ESQUE PERSON DO? And no, no eye lasers, yet.

"NOOO! DON'T!!!" Shine screams as Arado charges on, taking a cyborg in the head as he leap forwards and throws the whole package. It drops Rio and Ryoto, as he kicks out at the other one. It no-sells the shoulder blow and swings the gun to point at the boy. With a blur, his arm comes up to block the gun, as he blurs forward to headbutt the thing. Already weakened by Ryo's gunfire, V3s helmet-face cracks, the tertiary eye popping out.

There are now 4 cyborgs around Arado. One, seemingly the leader, is picking up the bed the boy threw at him, along with Shine. V3 is backing off and crouching to leap. ST is moving towards the exit, and ZX has just pulled the pin on his grenade.

Things go into slow motion as the situation escalates. V3 leaps over Arado's head, headed for the main ramp. Hongo rips off Shines restraints. ZX throws the grenade.

Arado spins and kicks the grenade towards ST and V3, then he grabs Johnathan and tosses him at Hongo. The impact of the 40-year-old is enough to distract the cyborg enough to grab Rio and Ryoto and jump onto the bed. But Shine is already running, and Hongo throws Johnathan aside and draws his pistol.

The Grenade goes off. V3 and ST are engulfed in blue flame.

Dropping Rio and Ryoto, Arado kicks the gun aside, although the bullet grazes his leg. He throws out a big punch, but Hongo manages to roll with it, and throws out a leg to trip Arado up. Arado stumbles towards Johnathan's body, and then rolls aside as the cyborg jump away firing. It makes it halfway to the ramp, where it picks up Shine and the 4 badly wounded cyborgs rush outside.

Arado stands up, noting the energy drain in his artificial muscles and organs. He's breathing heavily, something he didn't know he'd need to do anymore.

I think you did pretty well, considering your regeneration wasn't fully complete.

Arado ignores the voice, and checks the fallen ones. They all seem battered and bruised, but otherwise fine. Rio stirs and lifts herself off the bed.

"A-Arado...?"

The Boosted Child starts worse when he'd been electrocuted a few minutes before. "H-how do you know my name?"

*Oh right. I didn't explain that, did I?*

---

The Soldifat boosts skywards, firing off missiles at those damned artillery mechs as it seeks the black shadow.

"I wasn't just seeing things, was I? That thing was real, it was th-"

Arado's suspicions are confirmed as the black WildWurger rises in of the Soldifar and jabs out with the Beetle Crusher.

Hitting the rear boosters, the Soldifar spins through the Crushers grab area and back to the ground. Arado raises the beam machinegun. "Where'd you get the Wurger? Did you steal it from the California base?"

"...It is you."

"You're that Black Knight character! Why do you keep following me?"

The StealthWurger lands in front of the Soldifar, in a relaxed yet mobile stance. "Don't you recall anything, Arado? What we had together? Have you forgotten completely?"

"Oh... Oh man lady, you've got the wrong guy."

"Don't call me lady! We were lovers, Arado! Did they take that away from you too? All those precious memories?"

"Oh no, no no, not this! You've got the wrong Arado, Ouka! I'm with the Irregulars, I'm from a totally different world! In my world, you were just my sister, nothing wierd like that happened!"

The Wurger stops a moment, then the Crusher opens again. "Maybe you are. Or maybe you're lying. Either way, I have to take you back. Seolla!!"

"Whu-" Arado spins around too late, and armor-piercing shells tears through the Soldifars legs. It comes crashing to the ground as the StealthFalken lands atop Trilobite 2.

The whisper comes over the comm. "Was that good enough, sister?"

The Soldifar squirms in the Wurger's grasp. "That was perfect, Seolla. Absolutely perfect."

---

The remains of the Snake, now squirming along like a worm, flops down in front of the Snail's cracked shell, with the Bat hobbling in behind. Ruined Bartols lie everywhere. One twitches, and then is crushed by Albero's Gespenst. The one-armed, bleeding mech and the remainder of its squad stand before the corrupred Chokijin, battered by still alive, as alive as things like that can be.

"You know, I'm almost looking forwards to seeing you again, guys. You really make things interesting for a jaded old soldier like me."

Kai manages to raise the head of his busted Gespenst. "Dammit, why can't you just go back to the hell that you crawled out of?"

"Actually, thats exactly what I'm doing. Later, Kai. Don't let anyone else kill you."

And in a flash, the monsters and the mechanoids are gone.

The dragon-thing lands before your drained Raioh, looking where the things had been standing. "So... the Guardians of this world were corrupted by the Einst... That must be why they're able to work so freely here."

"Yeah... Kusuha, what do we do now? All I know is that we're in China, can you contact the others?"

"Now hold your horses, kids." The Ashsaber lands atop one of the new hills in the area, dislodging an alien corpse you'd splattered against the rock. Vindel seems almost cheerful. "I think you owe us some explanations. I'd like to know exactly what these 'Einst' are. But first..."

The Ashsaber turns to you. "Tell me, Raioh pilot, what exactly has happened to the Shadow Mirror?"

"I sure as heck know more about whats going on than you do, Mr Mysterio, and I've been in space for the past two days talking to aliens!"

"What?"

"You heard me! While you've been assing around around here, we've been busting our asses doing your job! We've made alliances with the DC, the Irregulars, and a bunch of aliens we didn't even know existed yesterday! What the fuck have you been doing?"

"Rrrrgh... Lemon and I have unfortunately been the unwilling guests of the ELF since we were forced to escape the fracas at TLI. It wasn't our intent to leave any surviving Shadow Mirrors without guidance, the decision was taken out of our hands by them. But, it seems you've managed to survive in some fashion, and with enhanced abilities, given how you snatched my own Zweizergain away from me. Where is that going, exactly?"

"The Zweizergain is with Axel now, he'll know what to do with it."

"What does that mean? What are you planning?"

"The same thing we've been planning for days, while you've been sitting on your arse drinking tea and playing the violin. If you want to know more, you can ask him yourself!"

"...You're quite the impertinent one, aren't you? Very well, where is Axel?"

"...Dumi should have been back to pick us up by now... Where the heck is he?"

The Dragon-Grungust raises a claw. "Um, you wanted to know about the Einst, was it?"

Vindel seems to perk up at this change of pace. "Yes, I'd be curious to know what connection these beasts have with both our worlds..."

---

The Dygenguar hovers in midair, its Zankantou at full extension, pointed at Dumi's bow. "Hold there! State your name and allegiance, we would know what right you claim to that cargo."

*I am... The Dynamic Unlimited Military Intelligence, and I am under orders to deliver this package to my superiors in the Shadow Mirror. Perhaps once they are done with their battle, you may ask them who it belongs to.*

"Hngh, just a computer. Gilliam, Ratsel, should we stoop to theft?"

Gilliam frown. "I'd rather be a theif than to risk more damage to our units. If we can claim it now, or even just destroy it, it would mean we can forsake this world finally, and figure out a way to get home. Apologies, D.U.M.I. but we... Hold on..."

*No, you hold on, Gilliam Yeager. You listen to me now. Things have escalated far beyond what you had imagined.*

"What... Sanger, Ratsel, be ready!"

The Zweizergain strikes the XN Giest straight in the face, sending it reeling and the mechs of Tandem Brigade flying off their rickety perch. Sangers sword flashes, but the transport is already above him, and mutating.

*I am not your enemy, Irregulars, not in this world, but it seems you mean to shatter my dreams regardless.* The winged form of Duminass looks out over the battlefield. *You've brought a storm, whether it is caused by your actions directly or as an unintended consequence, I don't know. Even if you wanted to leave this world, you couldn't. Not as you are, not with this cloying darkness sweeping in from the Frontier. Enough even to cripple me, who was born of such things.*

The three Ex-Aggressors keep their weapons trained on the otherworldly thing. Gilliam hazards a reply. "So, Duminass, you're saying your master is targeting us even here?"

*...I don't know. It could be him, or it could be something worse. And that frightens me. A lot.*

---

Vindel looks pensive as Bullet and Kusuha narrate, among other things, the circumstances of his death. "You paint an... odd picture of how our plans might have gone, had we made the jump. You're certainly fairly sure of what we would have planned..."

"Ignore him, Brooklyn." You fold your arms. "So it sounds like these beasties were beaten, of you killed the place they come from."

"Yeah, but... I guess they did things differently in your world. At the very least, they've been more active here. With the Guardians dead, they could have manipulated humanity for hundreds of years! What we've seen could just be the tip of what they have!"

Vindel shakes his head. "No... This strategy of infiltration and quiet rule, the police-states and the firm but subtle suppression of dissent, it can mean only one thing... These aliens are weak."

"Huh?" You, Rand, Bullet, Kusuha all speak at the same time.

"He means compared to the things Bullet and Kusuha fought in their world." Kai has managed to get his Gespenst to its feet again. "Those things were an army, a force like they just sent here would have been nothing to them. But here, they hide inside mechs, they steal the identities of humans, and they rule with finesse, not force. If they've been here for hundreds of years with any level of strength, they'd have done much better for themselves. There must only be a few of them, a couple of smart ones that run things, manipulating things behind the scenes to slowly make the Earth, and the humans, dance to their tune."

Vindel nods. "Precisely. The EFA must be their masterstroke, created after years of struggling to unite earth, so that they can stabilize everything. They've been building our planet into a cozy nest, an artificial home away from home."

Kai grins. "You must be loving this, Mauser. You've finally gotten an excuse for all your anarchistic bullshit."

"Quiet. Now, if our new teleporting ship isn't going to arrive on its own, we'd best make our own way to the other Shadow Mirrors. Thankfully, Junkers has left a few bulk transports around, we can get underway in a short period.

---

The Vaisaga's blade flashes, and chunks fly off the R-1. The EFA mech stumbles backwards, then transforms and flies off, the remaining EFA forces following behind it. Axel rests the Vysaga on its sword, and looks up at the retreating group.

"Dammit, they've got our people!!"

The Soldifar lies battered in the Black Knights grip, and the cockpit block of the Schutzwald in that of the R-3. This on top of the disappeared Russel. Axel's heart sinks as he sees a Space Noah class rise up from the jungle to meet the escaping units.

"Dammit, who's still active? We need to pursue! I'm not leaving anyone else to the EFA dogs!"

"Trilobites are out of commission sir! There were EFA saboteurs, we'll need hours to repair the damage!"

"Irm here, Tesla Drives acting up."

"Iisaki. I've used my ammo reserves."

"Lamia here, in pursuit!"

"Masaki here, me and Ryuune will save Arado!"

"...The Thrudgelmir will go nowhere. I protect Magus!"

"Luckfield here, I am up for running these beggars down!"

"Star Team here, we're low on ammo but we can back you up!"

"Ring here, Huckebiens still good, Jayce is looking for your spare Gespenst."

Axel smiles humorlessly. "Vysaga's not in the best of shape, so I'll just have to catch up... Wait, wheres that sniper? Subota, where are you?"

"Sir... Dumi has... changed!"

"What?"

"He's turned into something else... and I think he's going to give the Irregulars the Zweizergain!"

"Lamia, Star Team, Ring, get after them! The rest of you form up on me!"

Masaki breaks onto the comms. "Wait, what's this about the Zweizergain?"

"Shut up you green-haired idiot!! Dumi, what the hell are you do..." Rising over the Jungle, Axel see the true form of the thing that was once merely the DGG-04. "What... the hell are you?"

*It's rather complex, but for now, I'll say I'm on your side still, I've just had to be coy over my origins. I'm as trustworthy as any of your other impromptu recruits.*

"Really? What about the Zweizergain?"

*The gambit hasn't paid off, I'm afraid. The Irregulars, like smart people, lay in wait for us to bring it to them. If you want it, you're going to have to fight them for it. I decided it wasn't worth my time to do so.*

Axel sizes up the XN-Giest, and the 2 new super robots guarding it. "I'm a bit more tactically flexible..."

*Frankly, I don't think the thing is worth any more fighting over. Its main purpose is interdimensional travel, and with conditions in the greater multiverse worsening, it can't even do that right now. It's essentially junk right now. It's no longer even a good bargaining chip, since you'd have to kill the people you'd be selling it to.*

"And you think you can just go over my head and decide that?"

*Helios Olympus and his friends are right there. The Zweizergain is between you and them. If you want it, go and claim it. I'll stay out the whole thing.*
