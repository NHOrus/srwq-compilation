# Episode 18

##SRWQ Mission 18: It's Legal now.

Where last we left our brave adventurers, they had been given a quest by the rebel leader Van Vat Tran, to retrieve the missing scientist Sophia Nate from the dark dungeons of the Earth Cradle, before the fiendish forces of the EFA get to her first.

Our chosen warriors and their mighty steeds are:

+ Katina Tarask, the team's Crazy Person, in the WildRaubtier.
+ Masaki and Ryuune, heroes from another world, in Cybuster and Valsione
+ Shuu Shirakawa, self-declared Scientific Saviour of Earth, in the Invincible Earth Liberation Warrior Granzon
+ Latooni Subota, School Graduate, Ice Queen and secretly in love with danger, in the Soldifar.
+ Dumi, the Dynamic Unlimited Mitilary Intelligence, a very helpful AI, in the transforming super-motorbike DGG04
+ Ibis Douglas, gun nut and artillery specialist, in a Schutzwald.

Mounted on the mighty sky-vessel Trilobite, our heroes soar over the lost continent of Africa towards a most fateful encounter...

"Katina, do you see anything out there?" Ibis asked from the cockpit of the Schutzwald.

You turn away from the window and look over at her. "Nothing, couple of Lion-Vs escorting the shuttle. If they have any new models to go with their alien tech, they're still stowed away."

"Fair enough. I guess the Barrellions aren't for long-distance flight..."

"You a fan of the Barrellion?"

"My friend Filio helped design them, and I helped to test-pilot them along with Sleigh. I actually had a pretty good custom version by the end of the first war, but then Sliegh dissappeared, and I abandoned it when I went looking for her..."

"Maybe we should ask Vat Tran if he has any spare, trade the Schutzwald for one."

"Do you really think that's a fair trade?"

"...Probably not."

The command crew call over the speakers. "Ten minutes to target zone. Be prepared for nighttime combat."

"Acknowledged. What's the terrain like?"

Ensign Vicky (who is not a w-series) pulls up the data the DC gave her. "It's hilly desert terrain, just the other side of the Sahara proper. You're looking for a half-melted black dome in a wide valley."

"Gotcha. And enemies."

"The passive sensors are picking up signatures that look like 2 EFA ships of a similar class to the ones we saw this morning. Also, we saw what looked like Reentry Capsules dropping in a hundred klicks to the north, so they will have backup coming."

"Right. Guys, you think we need any special plan here?"

Ibis frowns on the comm window. "D-do we have the firepower to take on battleships?"

Dumi cuts in. *I suspect Masaki, Ryuune, and Dr. Shirakawa may have the capability to threaten the ships. I may be able to assist them in this. The rest of the group can take on the PT complement. If we have problems, the larger units can lead the EFA away while Katina and Latooni take their smaller mechs into the Earth Cradle and find the target.*

"Ok, Ibis, Lat, you hit 'em low, I'll hit 'em high!"

"Right!"

"Understood."

First out of the Trilobite are you and Masaki, the Cybuster surging ahead as if it were part of the wind itself. He's well away from you by the time the EFA forces notice you.

Dozens of Gespensts, Schutzwalds, and Raubtiers turn to face the oncoming threat, their fire bursting around Cybuster like a shower of sparks, but he weaves his way through it almost effortlessly. Then a few of them notice you.

Angelg and Valsione are close behind you, and you're facing 3 enemy raubtiers and 2 gespensts.

"Back me up Girls!!" You gun the afterburners and charge at the nearest enemy, who was sorta expecting you to dodge all the missiles he just fired. Instead, you boost through the swarm of ordinance and fire several pulses of the beam cannon. One blast shears off his wing as he attempts to avoid you nearly ramming him, and he transforms to PT mode to stabalise, only for a burst of beam shots from Latooni to strike him in midair.

Ryuune draws an ornate blade from... somewhere, and chases after another Raubtier which is firing on her. She jinks past the incoming fire and lands a hit, but its not fatal and the Raubtier turns and boosts away. Lamia soaks several missile hit but puts a plasma arrow right through the cockpit of the third, sending it to the ground in flames.

You're about to turn to assist Ryuune when a shell cracks against the side of the Raubtier. Minimal damage, but it reminds you there are 2... no, 4 Gespensts now, bearing down on your group. The rest seem to be distracted by Masaki.

The Gespensts send Slash Rippers after you but you dodge in a wide arc, as 3 DC Lion-Vs swoop in to assist.

The Granzon is ignoring the main fight, heading straight for the battleships, who have been too busy firing at Masaki. Latooni is in range with her large Bit Gun. Dumi is carrying Ibis into range.

With the Lions distracting the Gespensts, you take the time to gain some hieght, and swoop back down. "Latooni, suppression fire!"

"Alright." The shoulders of the Soldifar open up and unleash volleys of missiles, which fly into the EFA formation. Several Gespensts are hit, the others scattered, and you pounce. One pops like a bubble under a beam shot, the other takes a missile to the tesla drive and plummets to earth, dashing itself on the hills below. The other two are disabled by the Lions.

Suddenly, a storm erupts in the heart of the main EFA force, with Cybuster in the centre. His mech unleashes wave after wave of green-blue energy, washing over the EFA units and beating them back. A dozen are crushed by the force, another dozen disabled, and two of the battleships are pushed back by the force, nearly colliding.

"Masaki, I didn't know you could do that!"

"It's the Cybusters greatest trick, but it takes a lot out of the both of us. Could you guys come in and give me some backup, I'm low of juice here!"

Ryuune finally takes down her target and boosts in Masaki's direction. However, as she does so, she provokes a concentrated response from the Schutzwald squadron, who are on the ground and thus were sheltered from Masaki's attack.

Two DC Barrelions are flying in to support you.

"Dumi! Do what you do best!"

*Very well.*

The massive shape of Dumi zooms in and puts itself between the Valsione and the Schutzwalds, soaking up a dozen beam blasts. With the distraction, your own forces open up, firings precision beams and railguns into the EFA lines, taking out several and forcing the others to ground.

"Don't waste ammo guy, I can handle this!" Ryuune flies down, almost to ground level, and begins to spin. The Valsiones shoulders emit pink streamers of energy, which tears up the ground and sends the surviving Schutzwalds into disarray. As the second energy storm comes to an end, the only remaining Schutzwald begins to retreat, but a green burst guts the cockpit.

"Woah! Look at that!" cries Ibis.

The white Guarlion-esque suit lowers its weapon and transforms, into a Raubtier-like flight mode. "This is Star 3 to all DC units, follow my lead. Shadow Mirrors, take the battleships." With that, the woman boosts off after Dumi, followed by her troops.

---

"This is Shuu, I've disabled Battleship 1, they're retreating."

"Huh? But the thing isn't even scratched!"

"All the damage is internalised. My Worm Smasher works perfectly!"

"...Huh."

"Unfortunately..." And now you're cresting the rise and see the Granzon sitting in a bubble of energy, being showered in energy, "...overuse has caused some fluctuations in my motive systems. I could use a small measure of assistance."

"Ok, Brainiac, we'll see what we can do."

You have two EFA battleships, who's escorts have been cyflashed away, to stop before Granzons G-Wall gives up the ghost. At your disposal are the WildRaubtier, Soldifar, Schutzwald, and Angelg. 

A storm of AAA jumps up at you from the two Kestrels as you charge in, firing off missiles at vunerable points on the hull of the first. Several sensor nodes and weapon emplacements are struck, but the WildRaubtier isn't the force of destruction the Raioh was.

You pull up, a shell grazing your hull. "Turrets are too well-armored... Lat!"

"Attacking." The Soldifar boosts upwards to gain hieght, and fires its Bit Gun through the gap between the Kestrels main and secondary hulls. The beam strikes the barrel of one of the turrets, and burns into it armor, showering the crew and systems inside with molten metal.

"Supporting!" Ibis dodges a APT missile, blocks several shells with her arms, and fires her beam cannons at another turret. It pops like a blister.

"Going for the kill! Haaaaaaaa!" Lamia charges in, a half-dozen images of the Angelg giving way to one powerful blade strike to the bridge of the ship. The command deck is sheared away, and the ship goes nearly silent.

"Hah-ha! Take that, oppressors of the people!"

"Lamia?" Latooni seems almost confused.

"Er... I'll work on my diaWOOF!" The Angelg narrowly dodges a beam from the last battleship, which is redoubling its effort. The Schutzwald takes a missile head-on and loses an arm, and even Latooni has to seek cover.

"Akashic Busteeeeerrrr!!!" The Cybird flies through the enemy formation, wreathed in flamelike sorcerous power, and sends enemy suits flying, several exploding from the force. In his wake, the DC forces fly in, unloading their railguns into the beleagured troops. Against the old DC, these upgraded Gespensts would have done quite well, and held their own easily. But these were Van Vat Trans best, in top-of-the-line mechs, and with thier numbers drastically cut, the EFA grunts couldn't compare.

"This is Star-3 to Lion wing, intercept the ones that are retreating. We have to prevent them calling reinforcem-" The woman controlling the Altairlion gasps as two of the units she had just called on explode as armor-piercing rounds tear through them. Then a large beam strikes out of the hills to the north, and strikes a barrellion dead centre, sending it to the ground in flames.

"All units evade! Enemy reinforcements!"

Firing the beam cannon as fast as you dare, you fly close over the hull of the Kestrel, taking out weapon emplacements as you go. Behind you, the front of the hullis wreathed in plasma as Lamia fires a Phantom Pheonix, but the ship stays aloft.

"Damn, go down you frickin' whale!"

Lats voice comes over the comm. "The Granzon is clear, perhaps we should disengage and assist the DC."

"Why? Can't their fancy AMs handle themselves?"

"Not against this. A new EFA force of customised Gespensts has arrived. Half the DC are dead already."

"What? How?"

"It's the Cry Wolves, Katina. The EFA's special recovery team. They've come for Dr. Nate, and we're in their way."

"Ok, we'll go for Dumi's plan. Everyone cover me and Lat, we'll make a run for the Earth Cradle!"

"Roger!" The group rushes to support the DC, and streams of fire start to volley back and forth across the hills of Mali. Meanwhile, sticking close to the ground, you fly down the length of the valley, with Lat coming behind.

The valley is covered in the rusting hulks of Gespensts and Lions, marking the site of the last great battle of the Neo-DC/Inspector War. Up ahead looms the cracked dome which is the entrance to the Earth Cradle, once the DCs ultimate sanctuary, now a desolate ruin.

"If they're half as smart as they think they'll are, they'll have someone sent ahead to the Cradle... there!!" You dodge to the side as beam shots come from the sides of the valley. You can see a black Gespenst, clearly non-standard, blazing away at you, and coming far too close for comfort.

"Gespenst Custom, Halloween type. Definitely Cry-Wolves." Latooni doesn't even break stride, launching missiles and rapid-fire beam blasts back at the unit, which charges forward in a evasive pattern.

"Lat, keep him off my back!!" You open up the Afterburners and boost towards the dome, as Latooni counter-charges, drawing her beam saber as she approaches. She dives through a burst of split missiles and attempts a slash, but the Gespenst dodges backwards, and swings the butt of its oversized cannon around to knock her away.

A grizzled voice, male. "Nice try, but if you're going to get rid of me, you'll have to work for it." The Jet Magnum whizzes past the Soldifar's head, followed by two offhand punches and a kick, and then the Gespenst is boosting into the sky, the secondary barrel locking into place as he aims at the Raubtier.

"You're doing the work for me..." Latooni swings up the bit gun.

Both beams hit simulataneously. You howl at the WildRaubtiers right engine turns to scrap, and hurriedly transform and make a hard landing. You look back, and see the Gespenst land, a massive hole where the cockpit should be.

A hole which is already covering over with green rope-like tentacles.

The man who should be vaporised sounds like he wants to laugh. "Sorry, but that's not a very good resume. I'll require a fresh application."

"Lat, keep him pinned, we'll back off together!" You start squeezing off shots, but he's moving again, while firing off missiles.

"What, you think because I soaked one hit that I like it? Gotta make you work for it, girls!"

You dive backwards as the missiles throw up the ground you were standing on. Latooni runs towards you, firing, but only scores minor hits.

"Dumi! We could really use a hand right about now!"

*Actually, I think you may have assistance already.*

"What? Where?"

The drill erupts out of the groun and kerrangs off the Gespenst, sending it crashing to earth. the hole it made erupts into a fountain of earth, as something massive tears itself from its rocky womb.

"I AM WODAN! WODAN YMIR!!! ALL WHO TRESPASS ON THE REALM OF MAGUS... SHALL PERISH!!!"
