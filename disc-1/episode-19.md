# Episode 19

##SRWQ Mission 19: This could be the start of a beautiful relationship

The hulking monstrosity rips itself out of the ground even as it transforms, the red under-mech being slowly consumed by the white plaque spreading across it, turning it into something... else.

I AM WODAN! WODAN YMIR!!! ALL WHO TRESPASS ON THE REALM OF MAGUS... **SHALL PERISH!!!**

The WildRaubtier settles on its right shoulder, blazing away at the EFA mech in front. "AND I AM KATINA TARASK, THE THUNDEROUS FURY! TODAY, WE STAND AGAINST THESE ENEMIES AS COMRADES!"

It's only now that you notice theres another PT-sized mech on the other, tranformed shoulder, which presently pulls out its own rifle and blazes away at the retreating black Gespenst.

"NONE SHALL ESCAPE!!" The still-changing giant hobbles forward, the drill on its left arm pointed forward like a lance, aimed at the fleeing Cry Wolves unit.

An arm is blasted off the fleeing Gespenst as it desperately dodges another Drill Boost Knuckle, the limb barely hanging on by another green rope. Another shot takes off half its head. But the thing is fast, and boost skywards, out of range of even your weapons.

Not that you're too worried, with your new friends and all.

"AWESOME! Mr Wodamir, can I just call you Whodes?, you have one seriously twisted mech! Is that a Grungust underneath it? I gotta steal some ideas for the Neo Grungust off you. And you... what the heck is that unit? Oh, we came to rescue Dr. Nate, is she here?"

A girls voice, sounds like someone Latoonis age. "Your friend is heading inside the Cradle to retrieve her. Meanwhile we should see off these EFA scum, don't you think?"

"Sounds like a plan. Hey, Ryuune!"

"Oh god, Katina..."

"Ryuune, shoot that black Gespenst before it gets aw-"

"Katina, get out of there, that's Wodan!"

"Yeah, Wodanamir, he told me that, quite loudly, when he burst out of the ground."

"He's dangerous! He... he..."

"He just saved us from a demon tentacle gespenst and he's awesome and cool! Back off!"

"But... wait... we fought him in our world... he must be like Lamia, the same version, but he never got through the portal. Wodan, what... what are you... going to do?"

"Nggh... I am... Wodan Ymir... Magus, the Machine Cells... they're... I understand..."

"Wodan?"

"I... am the Sword of Magus... The Shield of Sophia..."

You look down at the almost-transformed mech. "Huh, Whodes buddy, you ok?"

The girl speaks up. "The Machine Cells haven't fully integrated into his system yet. We didn't have time to complete the transformation before the EFA attacked you."

"Ok, I... guess..." You suddenly notice that the WildRaubtiers feet are stuck in the white outer layer which is forming on the giant mechs shoulder.

"These Machine Cells, they're not hurting him, are they?"

"No no, they're repairing the damage that was already there. When we found him in the desert, his cyborg enhancements were all damaged, and his mind was fracturing. We were using the Cells to revive him when we detected your battle."

"Huh... so these things affect bodies as well as mechs."

"They're designed to be adaptable to multiple tasks, they were meant to preserve the Earth Cradle and its occupants for thousands of years."

"Ok... er, should I be standing in this? Is it ok for me to move, without messing up Wodan?"

Wodan speaks up. "I... am fine. Magus is coming forth."

The whole assembly turns to see the Soldifar emerging from the dome, carrying what looks like a 15-metre-tall metal rose. Lat comes on the comm. "I have retrieved Dr. Nate. What is the battle situation?"

Ryuune looks down on the group, her concenr mirrored on the Valsione's face. "The Cry Wolves retreated when the Thrudgelmir showed up. We're packing up everyone onto the ships... I guess you'll be coming aboard then."

The girls voice has a happy ring to it. "Of course!"

---

The girl who steps down from the cockpit of the Bergelmir is an odd-looking creature, with grey skin, and hair colored in strands of pink and blue. This is neatly mirrored in the complexion of the woman who emerges from the metal rose.

The Shadow Mirrors, and the woman in DC uniform who came aboard, look confused to say the least. Ryuune and Masaki look aghast.

"Ugh...  what the heck happened to you?"

The woman steps forward. "I apologise, I must look quite shocking, but integration with the Machine Cells was the only way we could survive the destruction of the Earth Cradle. Only with our bodies altered could be survive in the depths, create...  Cynthias Bergelmir, and eventually tunnel our way to the surface to contact you."

Ryuune blinks. "You changed yourselves... wow, and... you're completely in control? Nothings gone rampant or anything?"

"I understand the concern, but frankly, our early experiments with the cells had very little success, and by the time of the bombing we were still having issues getting them to replicate. That they managed to revive us in just a few months is quite a miracle."

"Revive?"

"Cynthia and I were exposed to the cells at the time of the bombing, which left us clinically dead. We only... became active again a few weeks ago."

You whistle. "Heavy."
