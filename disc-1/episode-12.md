# Episode 12

##SRWQ Mission 12: This is biggest encounter yet and our heroine is at the Mardi Gras

We were following the exploits of the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask, a cutely-dressed psycho with many, many issues, as she tries to survive exploit the arrival of the OG Heroes to her dimension. However, we've gotten caught up in a major battle at which out heroine is absent, but her allies battle fiercely to save the last of the shadow mirrors from the girl in the pic. (Crappy MSPaint cut-and-paste art is a legitimate use of this board dammit!)

Irm throttles forward. "Russel, you and me will secure that R-Blade. Dumi, stop the Angelg from sinking. Echidna, Ibis, get those enemies off the Trilobite. Arado, see if you can't help Axel."

*Roger.* The DGG-04 switches to Motorad mode and dives underwater. The other all signal acknowledgement, except for Arado.

"Uh, are you sure Axel wants help? I mean... he is Axel, after all..."

"Just make sure he doesn't die!!" Irm and Russel head to were the R-Blade sank.

"Russel, can you see the R-Blade on the Sonar?"

"Yeah, its not down too far. Only a few meters... wait, its still moving!!"

With a burst of spray, the R-Blade boosts a short distance out of the water, and stabs downward with a blunted Tonfa. The weapon embeds itself in Russel's leg, as the R-Blade drags itself out of the water by the handle.

"Not yet! I'm too powerful to die to the like of you! I won't go back empty-handed!!"

"Oh no you don't! Jet Magnum!"

Irm boosts forward to strike the mechs head as Russel struggles to bring his gun to bear. At the last moment, theres a blur of motion. The R-Blade leaps up, letting the Jet Magnum smash the Tonfa, and its feet impact on the head of Irm's Gespenst. Russel swings round his gun and fires a burst at nothing, before the second tonfa comes down on his arm. Only a reflex twitch stops the arm coming off altogether. The R-Blade dissappears in a splash.

"Surrender to me, mortals, and you will become part of a grand design. Resist, and you have no future!!"

"Jaysus! Theres still a lot of fight in that cailin!"

"When we capture her, we'll have to introduce her to Katina. I'd imagine they'd get along like a house on fire."

"Literally."

The R-0s empty their G-Railguns into the Bridge of the Trilobite, but the armor just manages to hold. They're fleeing, running a merry chase from the Vysaga as it closes in, claws extended.

"Attacking a ship full of wounded. I won't even stoop to calling you warriors!"

The R-0s flit back and forth, firing their head vulcans ineffectually, before the air around them begins to explode. Mini-missiles from the Rathgrith strike one, disabling it and sending it crashing to the roof of the Trilobite. The other dodges the Schutzwalds beam cannon, but runs into a burst of autocannon shells, sending the mech retreating over the water, trailing smoke and sparks.

"Told you I was better with projectile weapons!" gloats Ibis.

---

"Give *huff* it up, *huff* girly. Your little black toy *huff* is wrecked!"

"You're *puff* not in great shape yourself, *puff* Almer!"

The Soulgain looks like a cat thats been thrown into a dog pound. The Schwartzritter looks like a cat thats been thrown into a dogfood blender. How its still flying is a mystery for the ages.

"M-mister Axel, I've been asked to ask you i-if you need help."

The Schwartzritter turns to face the Gaurlion. "That voice... Impossible!!!"

"Hah! Don't turn your back on an enemy. RULE ONE BITCH!!!" The Soulgain charges, and rams its fist into the cockpit of the Schwartzritter.

Well, technically. The fist certainly hits the Schwartzritter, but the force involved isn't exactly what you'd associate with 'ramming'. More... 'tapping'.

"Wait... what... what's going..." Axel head lolls about the Soulgains cockpit, and turns to the head up display thats off to the side of his viewscreen.

In one of those I-never-realised-that-until-now moments, Axel figures out that its the Soulgain's status indicator, and all the bars are in the red.

"Well... sonuva..."

The Soulgain starts to sink towards the ocean, like a drunk taking entirely too long to fall on his ass.

This whole scene seems to snap the Black Knight back to her senses, and she engages what few boosters she has left, and heads away the way she came.

"W-wait!!" The Guarlion reaches down and grabs the Soulgain, barely stabilising. If Arado were more technically minded, he might realise this is only possible because the Soulgain is missing so many components, but he's preoccupied right now.

"D... Did you recognise me?"

"I don't... how are you talking like a dead man?"

"Oh god, you do. Dang, I know you're not Latooni, that really only leaves Seolla and Ouka... Unless you're that hag Aquila. I really can't tell with that sock in your mouth."

"It's not... You haven't heard the last of the Black Knight, Pretender!!!"

"Dammit! Axel, do that healy thing you do and get flying again! We need to go after her!"

"...Axel?"

---

"What are you two trying to do exactly, kill the sea?" Ibis hovers over to the patch of spent shell casing floating around Irm and Russel.

"Very funny Ibis. The R-Blade pilot is being annoying, she won't retreat, she won't give up, and every few minutes she pops up to slash at us. But then again, she's practically helpless down there, and we've recovered everyone else, right?"

Confirmed, Lt. 2G. We must depart from this space as soon as possible, and remove the pilots of the Angelg and the Soulgain from their mechs immediately.

"What? Are they injured, Dumi."

"The W-series piloting the Angelg has been severely damaged. She will require both medical treatment and extensive maintenance. And the damage to the Soulgain has caused it to enter a malformed absorption loop, draining the pilot of vital energy in an attempt to remain operational."

"Damn! Trilobite 01, close to Dumi's position and prepare to recover two super robots, ASAP!!"

Then space rips itself open.

"Let the heavens tremble, let the Earth grow still, let the masses bow down in awe. For the salvation of our world is at hand! I, Shuu Shirakawa, Scientific Saviour of Earth, have come to this place to thwart all evil! With the power of the Invincible Earth Liberation Warrior Granzon, let injustice and corruption be scoured from our beloved home!!!"

The call for everyone to be awestruck is followed, but probably not for the reasons Shuu intended.

"...What the hell. It just came out of nowhere!" Ibis hefts her beam cannons and aims them. "Permission to fire."

"No!!" Arado screams over the comms. "That's the Granzon, the baddest mamma-jamma going! You don't want to start a fight with it!"

"He's right, we're in no condition to start fights with people who might be on our side. Russel, Ibis, watch for that shark in the water, I'll talk to him."

The Granzon floats in place, the head casting about the battlefield. "Hrrmm, I wasn't expecting this..."

"Dr. Shirakawa, I'm Irmgard Kazahara, son of Johnathan Kazahara. You met him once before, didn't you, at TLI?"

"Indeed!! A fine example of practical science, producing proud defenders of justice and advancing the scientific field!! What I learned there was well worth parting with my Clacker Engine theory!"

"Indeed... listen, we're kinda in the middle of something here, we have wounded people to tend to. If you could-"

"SHHHUUUUUUUUU!!!!"

"OH WHAT THE HELL!?"

"Who dares shout my name like that?"

"Don't even try it, Shuu! Cybuster is ready to stop you, in any world!"

"Young man, are you intending to stand in the way of justice?"

"What would a guy like you know about justice? What are you planning, Shuu?"

"I intend to take my Granzon and save the world! It is my life's work!!"

"You, save the world? No-one would want to live in a world that was 'saved' by you!!"

"Ah, no..." Arado strains the Guarlion as he carries the immobile Soulgain towards the Trilobite.

Irm overhears. "Arado, are these some of your friends?"

"No... maybe... I'm not sure. I'll check! Masaki, are you the Masaki who came from another world?? ...Wait..."

The Cybuster half-turns, looking at the group while keeping a watch on the Granzon. "Who are you guys? Are you with Shuu?"

"He literally appearred out of nowhere two minutes ago!!" Irm shouts. "Why would you think we know him?"

"Do you know who this guy is? He's-"

"I DON'T CARE!! AXEL AND LAMIA ARE DYING!!! Now let us get them out of their mechs, and we can sort out your issues later!!"

"...Ugh, alright... But don't think I'm letting this bastard out of my sight!!"

"Why would I ever want to hide." Shuu sniffs.

---

The Soulgain and the Angelg are loaded into the Trilobite, with Dumi and Irm staying outside to make room. The few medics of the crew rush to extract Axel, while Echidna and her specialists begin levering the warped hatch of the Angelg open.

"Alright, we'll have to fly carefully so that me, Dumi and you two can keep up with the Trilobi-"

"Cybuster can go round the planet in the time it'll take you to get anywhere!"

"...Well, that's nice, but the rest of us have to take it easy so our fuel will last all the way to Brasili-"

Shuu cuts in. "Theres no time for that kind of lolly-gagging, man!! Those people need to be brought to proper medical facilities immediately!"

"I know that, that's why we should get flying right now, and stop all this bickering!"

"Flying... is obsolete. With the new truth of the Granzon, our destination is already here!!! Witness my scientific genius!!"

The Granzon begins to glow green.

"SHHUUUUU!!! What are yo

---

u doing... Huh?"

Masaki stops, his blade at the Granzon's throat, and looks down at the jungle below him. "Ok, I know I sometimes lose my way, but not like that!"

"Masaki! Will you stop running off and attacking people you don't even know???" The Valsione has its hands on its hips, and its face mirrors Ryuune's own scowling expression.

"Ry-Ryuune!! I... I was just trying to find my way back to the others, and I detected the Granzon's signal, and-"

"And you decided to harass an innocent scientist?? I thought you were smarter than that at least!"

"Geez, I was just trying to-"

"WILL SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED??!?!?" Wails Irm.

---

Giado's minibus pulls up just beside the jungle hangar, as the two Trilobites land in the clearing. The first to hop out is a 25 year-old woman, wearing a frilly red dress, who looks over the scene with miscolored eyes.

"I hope they've brought back something interesting. Otherwise, I'm just going back to the Mardi Gras."
