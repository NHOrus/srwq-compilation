# Episode 26

##SRWQ Mission 26: And now things get complex

In our last episode, Dumi and Katina had infiltrated the Hellgate facility, smashed their way through the Bartols, and found the alien mechs that formed the core of the ODE system. However, once Katina had recovered the pilot of one such mech, she discovered that Dumi had inhabited the other, claiming it was his original body, and that he was actually Duminass, a servant of Dark Brain. He begged Katina for forgiveness, and in a tearful scene, she said he could stay on as his partner. Now they just have to deal with this facility they've ruined...

---

The winged brain-like thing that is now Dumi looks out over the squads of inactive Bartols floating in the central chamber. *Hmm... We have two major issues resulting from this. One is Dr. Jeurgens and his ODE system. Without my body, his systems network can't control the Bartols, its just a hivemind of normal humans. But I can't use the Bartols either, since that involves activating the system again, leaving me vunerable. If we intent to use these drones, then we're going to have to disconnect Juergen and his helpers, and bring the ODE system totally under my control.*

You shrug. "Don't see what good they are, they're just cannon fodder."

*A thousand mecha of any type is something to be reckoned with, particulary when the Shadow Mirror forces have less than two dozen currently. The other issue is the Neviim itself.*

"The which?" 

*This white sphere, the core of the asteroid. Its a giant alien factory ship, made for the mass-production of remote mecha and... well, I didn't get their full purpose the last time I was here. But, when you removed that girl from the main mech,* A wing indicates the japanese redhead you rescued, who flinches,  *You deactivated the stasis routines which kept most of the systems locked down.*

"So you mean... the aliens are gonna wake up now?"

*I'd imagine something is going to happen, yes.*

---

Juergen yells, both with his real voice and the one inside the system, as the DC staff abandon their rest pods and head to the evacuation areas. "No!! Don't leave, we need as many minds as possible to fight them off! Only by uniting with the ODE system can we hope to triumph!!!"

*You're quite the one-horse pony, aren't you, Dr Juergens?*

"You!!... Please, this is my lifes work, it can save humanity from itself. Don't take it from me!"

*I don't see how linking the minds of people into one homogenous mess can be that useful, but, I am willing to compromise on your existence. I want allies, not war.*

"What... What is your plan, Core?"

*My name is Duminass, and right now, my plan is to stay safe from the Balmar that are waking up.*

"The ones in suspended animation? Oh... my..."

*Allow me root access to the Bartol control system, so that you can't turn on me, and I'll return the ODE system to you. We can then coordinate a defense together.*

"...A-alright... but will that be enough?? The alien forces... They far outnumber what we were able to make, even with control of their factories."

*I hope it won't come to open battle, but if it does, I beleive Katina and I can even the odds.*

---

*Juergen will help for now, I have him trying to get a signal to the Junkers Faction. Now we need to make a desicion about the Aliens.*

"Ugh, like, to kick their slimy green butts or just to set them on fire?"

*It's a little more complex than that. The aliens are alien in... the not-from-earth sense. At least, some of them...*

"Huh?"

*Hold on. Dumi starts yammering in japanese again, to which the redhead answers haltingly. You float there as the two converse, fidgeting to try to make your rolled-up skirt comfortable inside your spacesuit.*

*It seems Mai here has no memories of anything happening since she was captured from... Japan, several years ago. Yes she was piloting the core mecha of the Neviim, the central piece of the Balmar hierarchy, and when I fought her before, she was quite convinced she was Levi Tolar, Mistress of Judecca. I would say a large segment of the Neviims crew may be similar captured humans. And, some of them may have been freed as well*

"Wait... so... are there any aliens or aren't there?"

*I don't know. Perhaps we should find out...*

"We gotta find the humans... Are there cables leading to them too?"

*Not that I can detect... nor that I'll be able to find easily*

"Why not?"

*I suppose I should start from the start... This Neviim arrived in your system years ago, hidden inside this non-descript asteroid, and I was the only entity to detect its arrival. I investigated and found the Balmar, but they attacked me with full force. I attempted to stop them by destroying the core of their system but the Judecca used Mai's powers to freeze both my body and the Neviim in stasis. Now that we've broken that stasis, the automated systems will start looking for me again. I don't want to risk anyone getting caught in the crossfire, look what the last battle did to this place.*

You recall the cracked and cratered surface of the white sphere, and the massive voids you travelled through to get to the core, only partly repaired by the DC. "Right, so... I should go alone to look?"

*I'm sending the Bartols to search as well. There are two main areas they can't break into though, we'll need Raiohs strength for that.*

"Right!"

---

You climb back into the Raioh and head for the crossroads that lead to the sealed areas.

After a bit of pounding, you crash into the smaller room, and find yourself surrounded by PT-sized mecha, in the green knight-esque design you saw on your way in. They seem to be inactive, except, for a small group in the corner, in slightly larger blue mechs. It seems they were also banging on a wallpanel with all their might.

The group turns to you and start waving the hands of their mechs frantically, in what you intepret as pleading motions. One of them appears to be exiting his mecha, revealing a man in unusual ornate armor, which appears to be attached to his body in places.

"Hey! The rescue party is here!! I'm come to get you out!"

The man in the armor breaks out into a massive smile. "Really! Oh, thank heaven!! We thought we were trapped in here!!"

"I'm Katina Tarask, who are you?"

"I'm Colonel Kar-Wai, EFA Special Test Te-"

"HOLY SHIT!! THE Colonel Kar-Wai?! Awesome!! I'm a friend of Kais!! I'll take you to meet him right away! Also, I'm gonna want an autograph later."

"A friend of Kais... Ok! People, double time after that big mech!" He reenters his mech, and the group floats after you. They finally manage to get their comms tied to yours. 

"Any other groups of humans about?"

"I... honestly couldn't tell you, miss. Last I recall, I was flying my Gespenst against one of the PTX girls in a trial, then I woke up in that room with all this itchy stuff stuck in my skin."

*Katina, we have an issue.*

"Dumi? I just found the first batch of humans, what have you found?"

*It seems the other area was the Balmarian sleeper storage, and its finished defrosting. If these readings are right, there's something like 20,000 aliens waking up and heading to see what's going on. If we're going to act, we don't have a lot of time.*

"Oh, dammit! We'd better book! Can you guys fight in those things."

Kar-Wai nods on the comm window. "We seem to be linked to them somehow, even though only a few of us have implants. We're not all trained pilots, but, it seems the aliens stuck us in these things for a reason."

"Right. I'll get you all back to the ship. Dumi, is Juergen leaving?"

*He's being a slowpoke about gathering equipment, but he's moving. The DC are unpacking their ships, they should be ready to leave within the hour.*

"Wait, we have an hour?" 

*We have an hour before the flesh-and-blood aliens can get themselves organised. The auto-defenses may not be such late risers. An hour to move 487 people into long-disused ships is actually fairly fast, you have to realise. These aren't Shadow Mirrors vessels, made with speed in mind.*

"Ugh... Ok..." You look back down the chamber. There's definitely a lot more blocks to this section, and you can't rule out there being more humans. On the other hand, you're not sure you'd want a fight in here, especially if these immobile units become mobile.

"Dumi! Start pointing us at stuff that we can break! We have to slow them down!!"

*This is a very large facility, Katina, and its quite decentralised. That we've distrupted the Judecca is probably the best move we can make to slow them down. Or are you asking me to permanently remove it?*

"Yes! And tell me what else I can do!"

*I'm maxing out the bandwidth on the local control nodes, that should distrupt drone activit-*

"What can I do?"

*...Alright, sending you the location of computation nodes in your area. Destroy them and the Balmarians should have difficulties figuring out what we're doing.*

"THANK YOU. Now, Team Tarask, move out!" 

---

Your group flies through the base, taking out anything that looks important or which registers as a sensor or data node. The Knights are armed with powerful cannons, which is handy because you're having issues putting large holes in the superstructure of this thing.

You quickly get to know your fellow teammates, and they're an odd bunch. There's Kar-Wai, who's slowly dismantling the armor he's wearing to the point where you can see most of his face (he ignores the bleeding). Theres an Indian woman called Radha, and a European woman called...

"Titty?"

"Tyutti."

"Tootsy?"

"Tyooo-Teeeee."

"I'm just gonna call you Starbuck, it'll save time."

"Norbuck. Nooorr-"

Kar-Wai interrupts the charming conversation. "There's something moving up ahead!! Look like some sort of... bugs, and there's quite a few of them!"

"Wait, they might just be wandering sensors, or maintenance bots, or-"

The ring-shaped laser crackles against the Raiohs armor.

"KILL THEIR SHIT!!!!"

The corridor becomes a charnel house as dozen of 10-meter-long bugs charge forward, only to be gunned down as the Ezekiels deploy their oversized cannons and mow them down. Through pauses in the firing you advance, crushing the tiny things with almost contemptous ease. A challenge for Gespensts or Lions, maybe, but you're outputting too much hurt for them to really register.

They soon stop coming, and you're left with a blackened crusty ruin that used to be a corridor full of mechs.

"Well, so much for our alien conquerors! Now, we press the atta-"

"BZZZTT-ome hear me? My name is Jennifer Fonda, and I'm trapped in some... giant robot thing... Please, if anyone can hear me, let me out of this thing! I don't want to die in here! I can hear noises outside, please, rescue me!!"

"...Dammit."

"Tracking the signal... This way!!" You lead your team back into the machinery area of the Neviim, into a different hangar. The mechs here are large and non-humanoid, floating in mid-air and generally being intimidating. 

"Signals from that one, third from the left... Don't worry, Ms Fonda, we'll get you out of there!"

"Not until you idiots explain yourselves!"

The grey Gespenst leaps and onto one of the floating mech and points an accusing finger, as the new arrival, a young woman, berates you. 

"I knew the EFA brass were idiots, but I didn't think them capable of genocide! Do you even realise what you're doing, you worthless cretins!"

Kar-Wai turns to the newcomer. "It's you, Hackman! And you're in my Gespenst! What are you doing, girl?"

"Saving an entire species, thats what!!"

"A species that treats human lives like playthings doesn't deserve to be saved!!" You leap up and swing a roundhouse kick at the Gespenst, but it backflips easily out of the way, lands on another floating mech, then flies at you, plasma stakes glowing evilly.

"You don't have the right to judge that! GESPY PUNCH!!"

The old-style Jet Magnum hits with unnatural force and sends the Raioh flying backwards. You stabilise, and send plasma leaders after the grey mech. "Why not? The evidence is right here! They've all been captured against their will and brainwashed! Kar-Wai is bleeding from the implants they put in him. These people cry out for justice!!"

The Gespenst dodges through the streams of lightning, hits the wall, and runs along it with booster assist. "And what kind of justice is killing the last of these refugees!?!? They came here for refuge, not doom! You heartless bitch, you're the monster here. ULTIMATE GESPENST KIIIIICK!!!!!!"

The blow sends the Raioh spinning 1080 degrees and careening into the mech with Fonda in it. Both massive machines crash into the floor, bouncing hard. You hear Fonda yell over the comms. The grey Gespenst lands on another floating platform, and deploys Slash Rippers. Over the ringing in your head, you vaguely hear Kar-Wai say something about modifications. You damage sensors indicate there a crater the shape of a Gespenst foot in your torso armor.

"Dumi!! How do I make the Machine Cells turn the Raioh Uber?"

*...What?*

"Like they did to the Grungust Type 3, made it into that awesome Thrudgelmir. How do I get them to do that?"

*Katina, you specifically asked that I not let them do that.*

"I know, but then this PTX bitch got in my way! I need to show her up!!"

*__Sigh__ Katina, the machine cells are a hodge-podge stopgap I had Tis put together using the remnants of the Earth Cradle experiment and some Dark Brain technology, in order to fix Sophia Nate and Wodan Ymir. They're nowhere near as powerful as we've been pretending they are, not without major energy input. Energy input you've been sucking up with all the repairs you've needed recently.*

You fend off the glowing Slash Rippers and block another kick. "What... what kind of energy? Can I plug myself into the mains here?"

*You'd either need me to charge them up directly, or to an accumulation of negative emotions on the scale of a small war. And no, your supposedly infinite rage is not enough.*

The Raioh and the Gespenst perform a cross counter, both units stumbling back. "I... see. Kar-Wai, what the heck are you doing?"

"R-right! Hackman, seriously, get a grip! Why would us humans fight each other when these aliens are here? Are you really going to ally with them?"

The glossy grey-black Gespenst picks itself up. "I... don't have a choice! I've seen what happened to them, their tragedy, their loss, I can't see that suffering and sacrifice and stand idly by while they're killed for 'security' and 'the public interest'! My mother didn't raise me like that!"

Lightning streaks out of your hands and grabs onto the Gespenst, hauling it into the air while you pour on the volts. "Did your mother also tell you to take it in the ass from alien gangrapists, you stupid whore?!?!"

The Gespenst strains against the electromagnetic force, then its chest opens. A beams of energy pours out of the gap and into the Raioh's face. The Plasma Leaders close to prevent feedback from melting them. 

The Gespenst crunchs to the ground near where Radha and Tyutti are retrieving an oddly-dressed Jennifer Fonda. Hackman groans. "Won't work... Computers run on crystals now, not microchips... damn, I feel all tingly..."

Kar-Wai grabs the Gespenst from behind and holds its still. "Dammit, Hackman! Will you stop babbling!?! What is this shit about the aliens being refugees? I have metal embedded in my skull, is that what refugees do?"

"No, you don't understand... I was negotiating to get you turned back, all of you. They made a mistake, they didn't know what was going to happen. The disaster on Balmar changed everything. I saw it happen, dammit! He ate them all!!!"

You have a sudden flashback of Kai holding you back from Arado as you rant about ghosts returning from hell.

"Ok, start explaining things to us dumb mortal, bitch, or I'll give you another zapping. What the hell is going on with these aliens?"

"They... They're called Balmarians. This Neviim is like a portable outpost, they were using it to check out Earth. They stayed a few lightyears away and they'd capture the odd person to get a measure of us. One day their bugs found Kar-Wai and me on an exercise. Scooped up his Gespenst and my Wildschwien and took us here. But apparently I was a particular type of sample, a 'psychodriver', they said, and there was a call from home base to send one back, so I was brought to Balmar."

"This sounds very wholesome and innocent so far."

"Shut up, I'm getting to it!! Anyway, I was on their planet a while, the ones on the home base were a lot more reasonable. They were saying that maybe they should make contact with Earth, form an alliance, or something. But then... him, the black thing... he rose up..."

"From where, a hole? His bed? Could you be a little more specific."

"...He... he was darkness... He covered the whole planet. I could hear them screaming in my head... He was eating their souls!."

"...Errr..."

"Only a few ships made it away, only about 20,000 people altogether. The only place to store them was here, on the storage deck. We put them in stasis pods and tried to plan a way to resettle them somewhere safe. The other ships went out, trying to find a safe place, but none of them came back. Laocidea said the only option was to negotiate with Earth, so we flew in... a nd then, there was a battle... People said it was another entity like the one from Balmar... We were on full battle alert, they said it was breaching the core. I was about to head out when... something happened... I remember being frozen... Then the new battle started..."

You set your face glumly. "Ok, ok, maybe we got off on the wrong foot here. We'll go to see the alien boss, and try to talk this out. We might be able to get this figured out without killing everything."

Hackman is still silent. 

Kar-Wai calls you on the comms. "Uh, Ms. Tarask, my mech is giving me a funny readout from hers. I think... she's fainted."

"OH FOR FUCKS SAKE!!!"

*Calm down, Katina, we can still negotiate with the Balmar. I'll just need a little while to assimilate their language and comms protocols from the Judecca, and I should be able to... Hrrmm.*

"Hrrm what!!? Dumi, stop being so damned vague!"

*Several groups of Bartolls are being engaged by the enemy drones. My computing power is being used up trying to hack the Judecca, I can't replicate the ODE learning system like the DC Hivemind could. And they have problems of their own.*

"Dammit, what the heck do we do?"

*This whole situation is escalating rapidly, Katina. I think the negotiations will have to wait until we're clear of the Neviim and can talk over the intervening distance. If we stay here and keep trying, the risk of the Balmar acting rashly will be very great.*

"Fuckballs..."

"OK people, we're getting out of here. Starbuck, take the Gespenst. Radha, let Jennifer into your cockpit. We're getting out of this hellhole!!"

You lead the charge through the winding corridors, following Dumis instructions for the safest route. Even so, you come across the remains of bugs and Bartolls everywhere, and even have to smash a few stray bugs yourself. But you and Kar-Wai are easily up to guarding the others.

You emerge with a kick onto the surface of the Neviim, near to a Peregrine battleship still sporting long-defunct UCC markings. The Eurydice is full, Katina, you'll have to hitch a ride with Juergens.

"Dammit... ok, everyone get in!"

You fly into the docking bay of the Peregrine, a snug fit as there are several black Bartoll-esque mecha also sharing the space. You hear the Peregrines guns going off, then a rough jerk as it accelerates into space. 

*The losses to the Bartol force are unfortunate, as is the failure to recover all of the ODE equipment, but I think the Shadow Mirrors have profited greatly from this.*

You sit back in the Raioh's control harness and smile. "Yeah... Shame about the DC though."

*Yes, it appears we may have set Lily Junkers back many years of investment in that base. But she, like the rest of Earth, have bigger issues to worry about right now.*

"Wait, you still haven't gotten ahold of the Balmar command yet? Dammit Dumi, you're supposed to be able to conquer planets and buttfuck dimensions, and you can't make a phonecall?"

*Aside from the technical issues with the Balmar technology, I was more referring to the response of the other factions on Earth. Most notably, the two sides of the EFA. Given that one is an alien force itself, and another is a unit designed to combat aliens, I find it unlikely they'll be negotiating with the same platform we will.*

"Then... I guess we'll just have to keep them a secret, won't we?"

*That would have been an option... If there hadn't been a major mech battle with the Bartolls as we covered our escape. The EFA can't fail to detect that sort of thing. They'll be coming here, soon, and in force.*

"...Dammit, why is becoming all-powerful so damned tedious?"
