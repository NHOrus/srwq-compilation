# Episode 20

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 20: Lets hope that was a temporary hiccup.

In our last episode, unfortunately cut short, the Shadow Mirrors were locked in epic combat with the Cry Wolves, when the very people they were sent to save came to their rescue. Sophia Nate, Wodan Ymir, and someone called Cynthia joined the team, and revealed how they had survived the destruction of the Earth Cradle: The mysterious power of the Machine Cells.

Now armed with a frightening new technology, the team returns to base, still unsure exactly what this could mean for them...

---

"-The fuck??" A random mechanic exclaims, looking on in shock as the Raubtiers melted engine housing reinflates, the parts inside reconfiguring into a working engine once more. Simultaneously, the new white paintjob is covered over by a matte black finish.

"Wo-ho!! Awesome!" you shout. "Dr. Nate, are your Cell things doing that?"

Dr. Nate nods. "It appears your mech was exposed during the Thrudgelmirs deployment. Unlike Wodan's unit, they must have had data on it's type, and are able to restore it to its original form."

"Holy shit, they even restored the stealth coating! What are they gonna do to me??"

Dr. Nate turns and looks at you, rather intently, and for a moment you think can see wierd lights in her eyes. Then she blinks, and shakes her head. "The cells didn't affect you. Their safeties were still intact. We made sure to program them to only operate on organic life when specifically ordered to."

"Aw... I kinda wanted to see if I'd grow claws or laser eyes or something."

"...We're at the dawn of a new science and we don't fully comprehend the implications yes. I intend to avoid using the Machine Cells until I have a better idea of what they can do."

---

"Wolf 1, what is your status?

"I feel great, only got vaporised once. Shit's gotten bad though."

"Have the Machine Cells been confirmed?"

"Check my gun camera, that big mech was certainly doing something wierd."

"Acknowledged. If this is truly an example of Type 2 Matter Manipulation, it must be dealt with immediately. Return your unit to Dakar base and await reinforcements."

"These guys have some serious firepower, easily equal to my team. And they'll have the DC backing them up now. I hope you aren't planning something half-assed."

The High Speaker grunted over the comm. "We can't afford to do that. We're sending the Hagane, and the Tsentr Project flotilla."

Albero Est grinned. "Oh goody. A family reunion."

---

"I'm not happy with all of this..." Ryuune says as she pulls you into a corner with the rest of the pilots.

"What? Aren't the regenerating death-robots up to your discerning standards?"

"Look... in our timeline, that guy in the Thrudgelmir was one of our most dangerous enemies, and nearly killed us all on more than one occasion. She was used by...  well, the Shadow Mirrors, as a brutally effective weapon, and... well, Masaki and me weren't actually there at the final fight with him, but he, and his buddies were a big deal."

"So? We're the Shadow Mirrors this time, and that means he works for us."

Lamia cuts in. "That's W-14, one of the more loyal W-Series. His circuits require he be... dedicated to one individual, which seems to be this Dr. Nate so far, but as long as we're on her side it should be fine."

Ryuune folds her arms. "I... I just have a bad feeling, is all. About them, and her."

Masaki rubs his chin. "I suppose in this world we have no way of knowing whether the Earth Cradle guys are friend or foe..."

"See Ryuune, your man isn't all suspiciou-"

"But my gut still tells me something's off."

"Goddammit!"

Ryuune frowns. "Wait, what did you call him?"

Masaki continues, oblivious. "And that Cynthia girl... I can't be sure but I think I've seen here before."

"You've seen lots of people before. You said there were counterparts for most of our friends on our team."

"...I dunno, maybe I am reading too much into it."

---

"Man, can't this thing go any faster? I wanna talk to Kai about stuff!!"

Lamia shrugs. "We can't, we'll just leave Wodan behind. The EFA might be shadowing us, we can't leave him vunerable."

"He's a big boy, he can look after himself! Besides, can't he just ride the Trilobite like a surfboard, like you, Brooks and Axel did on the way to Brazil."

She shrugs again, in a forced way, as if she's not used to making the motion. "I think Ryuune asked that he not be allowed on the ship."

"It's a big late to be bitching about Machine Cells going crazy and eating the ship! Or did she not see the Raubtier?"

Another forced shrug.

"Just how bad is this jamming, anyway? Can we contact the base if we gain some hieght?"

Lamia shakes her head, again stiffly. "The jamming is so bad that our internal comms won't even work. Radio waves across the whole north of Africa are being thrown out of whack. Only laser comms are working and they're LOS only. To get a view of the base, we'd have to practically break atmo."

"God fucking dammit!! How do the EFA have this ability?"

"According to intelligence, the effect is produced by massive satellites, which they have less than half a dozen of. They've only been deployed a hadnful fo times, but even with that, it was enough for us to upgrade the Trilobites with their passive sensor arrays. It's the only way they can operate under these conditions."

You sigh at the wasted oppurtunity to talk to Arado. "Oh well, I guess I'll have to amuse my self for an hour or two..."

Lamia cocks an eyebrow. "How, exactly?"

"Never underestimate my ingenuity?"

---

You find Latooni in the hangar, peering up at the gangly-looking Bergelmir intently.

"So, what was it like down in that scary ol' cave?"

"The interior of the Earth Cradle was exactly as I expected it, a burned-out ruin of melted metal. The only unusual element was the Magus System that Dr. Nate was sheltering in."

"'Kay... Wait, why was she hiding in a computer?"

"She didn't say, but its a safe extrapolation of the Machine Cells observed abilities that she's connected to it somehow. Hence why Wodan Ymir refers to them synonymously."

"...Right. So, what do you think of this whole Machine Cell business?"

"...It's dangerous."

"Oh-ho, really?"

"The potential applications are potentially limitless, and represent a potential paradigm shift in future technology, possibly even a move towards transhumanism. Any faction that truly masters them could potentially become indestructible. The true masters of the earth, warriors of eternal war..."

"So you'll be sticking close them, won't you?"

"...It would be foolish not to."

"Sounds like you want to get injected right now, Subota."

Latooni turns and looks at you quizically. "Does it? I was merely commenting on how desirable the technology is, to all factions. It can't fail to be the centre of conflict, whether you wish to use it, or, as the EFA seem to want, destroy it."

"And whereever there's war, the Shadow Mirrors have to be there, pulling the strings."

"That is their mission statement."

"OUR mission statement. Or don't you consider yourself a Shadow Mirror?"

Latooni is silent a moment, and looks around at the various death-dealing machines in the hangar. "I joined Shadow Mirror for different reasons than the rest of you."

"Really? Care to enlighten me?"

She turns to you, looking up at you with a like-thats-gonna-work look, her mouth threatening to turn to a smirk. "Do you really think you're capable of getting into my head, Tarask? Does your off-kilter personality give you great insight into the human psyche?"

"It's just a questio-"

"The Machine Cells are a Big Deal. I need to be close to them because what happens to them could determine the fate of the whole Earth Sphere. Its as simple as that."

Excuse me, wtf do you think you are doing? Reported for spamfaggotry.

Moving on, I do believe It's best not to prod too far into what Latooni's thinking right now. She's not yelling at us or ignoring us, so at least that's a step forward.

Is Axel on board this ship? If so, check in on him. If not, check on the Raioh's repairs.

If Raioh's not on this ship, then try to convince Ryuune to let Wodan on board so we can get where we need to go faster. Assuming she's on the ship.

...Come to think of it, what IS on our ship right now?

You beckon Latooni over to Dr. Nate, who appears to be working on the Metal Rose. "So, Doc...have you figured out what's going to happen with the Machine Cells yet?"

"...I've been out of the Earth Cradle for just over an hour. That's hardly enough to comprehend the implications of whats happened to me."

"Yeah, well...we're sorta curious about what the immediate plan is."

"Well, I had hoped to return to the DC base you mentioned. Beyond that...recover from being killed and then trapped for months in the ruins of my old home?"

"I meant, Are you sticking with the DC? Or are you planning to go solo now that you're...special?"

Nate looks rather glumly at you. "...I intend to renew my association with Colonal Vat Tran, and then decide where to go from there. I am not a warmonger, and I'd prefer not to fight if I can avoid it."

"And if you decide to hang up your labcoat and retire, who gets the Cells?"

"I don't know yet. As I said, there are a lot of implications to consider. But...I am far more trusting of Vat Tran's DC than any other group, I will say that much."

She seems to look oddly at you for a second. Her eyes have those flashes in them again.

"Why? Are you asking for them, here and now?"

That sounds sensible. It's not like we're the end-all authority within the shadow mirrors, so it's not like we can really make that decision ourselves.

Besides, something tells me it's good to have her on our side, rather than risk making her think we're going to take her stuff by force. Especially if it means the difference between having Wodan on our side, and having Wodan be the most powerful threat we could face right now.

"I-I..." you throw on your best moesad face. "I just want to know...where we stand. I've lost so many colleagues in the past few days...and so much has happened...I want to be certain of someone."

Magus' eyes flash again, and then her face softens. "I...didn't mean to sound overly righteous or uncooperative. It's just...I'm a little worked up about what's happened to me over the past while myself. I've had to question a lot of things, and do things that I would never have dreamed of doing before. That...takes a while to accept."

"I...think I understand. We Shadow Mirrors, we're also trying to find a place in the world, after losing everything. We have a lot in common, I guess."

"Yes...we do."

Latooni blinks, and enters her own commentary. "Dr. Nate, you may not have the luxury of time to choose your allies. Many factions will want your Machine Cells, particularly the EFA, who seem to already know about it, and have already tried to destroy you for it. You will need allies to protect you, and quickly. We, us two at least, will help you."

Sophia Nate smiles. "Thank you, both of you."

You drag Irm by the arm towards Trilobite 2 "Talking to Kai. Now. Evil Tentacle Conspiracy."

"...Why do I even bother trying to lead this team? They obviously do it themselves."

You find Kai tinkering away at his new Gespenst, affixing the last of the second set of plasma stakes to the right arm. "Well, how did things go?"

"Four, I want the other witness along too."

"Fine. Let's get this over with."

Latooni is obviously more interested in going with Dr. Nate, but acquiesces to the meeting.

Kai sits down once you get to the meeting room, but the rest of your stay standing. He looks at you, forcing one of you to start the conversation.

You start off, a little irritated. "When we got to the Earth Cradle, we were assaulted by the Cry Wolves, using long-range fire from the hills. Most of the team kept them pinned down while me and Lat went to find Dr. Nate."

Kai nods. "Standard MO for the team. They're all professionals, good at range except the few who idolise me too much, and securing unknown sites, and especially technology, was our speciality."

"As the two of us approached the dome proper, we were assaulted by a black Gespenst-"

Kai nearly jumps out of his seat. "A...a man? Gruff voice, late 30s, can't do the 'tache so he does a short beard instead?"

"Didn't see his face on the comm, but the rest sounds about right."

"....He's dead."

"Well that explains us fighting him in mortal combat then, and the way he shot down my Raubtier."

"Albero Est is dead. Beowulf put that oversized spike of his right through his cockpit."

"It was the Moon Cradle drop. The main fleet took on the DC's fleet, while three teams dropped in to secure the base. The Beowulves were to assault their main lines, The boys from the SRX project would penetrate the base and take out the aliens. And we Cry Wolves would secure the fancy tech, the Huckebien Seal and the other goodies they keep on the rim of the base."

"All went to plan. Beowulf kicked ass, then the super-secret SRX boys went into the base, didn't even get to see their units. We found the Huckebien and captured some alien units mostly intact. Then, as the fleet was winning, the surviving enemy forces tried to counterattack the base. Beowulf's unit got hit, and hit hard."

"It was Hugo who went first, and of course Aqua went right behind him. I made the call and the whole team moved out to support our 'allies'. Command was screaming in our ears, stay where we were, do our jobs, but I guess we were all too wrapped up in glory and honour or some shit. Big mistake."
Sciencegar Sciencebolt Fri 19 Feb 2010 02:57:47 No.4553182 Report
"We'd actually sorta wondered, why did the Beowulves stick to normal Gespensts, when the Gespenst Customs were so much better and not that expensive to make? Well, we got our answer fairly quickly. The Beowulves weren't using Gespensts at all. Inside the old-fashioned blue armor, was the EFAs big secret."

"They were monsters, no other word for it. Unkillable monsters. Tentacles everywhere, organic parts all over the place. Endurance and weapon power like I hadn't seen on a PT since the S prototype. And they were taking on numbers that would have wiped out a battalion, and winning easily."

"The team lasted maybe 5 minutes. And frankly, I give them kudos for that much. The monsters all but ate their units. Albero took a cockpit hit from Big Blue himself, can't have been much left but hamburger. Hugo and Aqua's suits were half-melted-down.

"I was on the ropes myself, but I took a gamble, that since they were killing us for having seen their secret, they couldn't let another faction see them. So I crashed what was left of my Gespenst right into the Moon Cradle's main building, where the SRX team was supposed to be. Blacked out from the crash. Woke up on the Kurogane, on the flight home, missing an eye."

"I was a guest at Izu base for a while, a rare enough thing these days. I didn't learn much about SRX itself, but they managed to let slip a few details to me, as they tried to recruit me into the fold."

"The way their boss put it, there's two main factions in the EFA right now: The Council of the First and Only, the ones with the organic tech, they control Geneva. Project SRX, on the other hand, has the best Earth tech, and all the DC scientists that were captured during the war. The military is split between them, kept in the dark over the two sides, taking the two sets of objectives as best they can.

SRX claimed the First and Only are aliens, trying to take over Earth from the inside, and wanted me in on it. But I wasn't a fan of SRX, or the School that spawned them, and what I saw in Izu base didn't convince me any better. I just could see them having good intentions for earth if they won."

"So I figured, I need to get these two sides fighting each other properly. End the cold, secret war, and start a proper, hot war. Get both sides to put their cards on the table, and see what they're really packing. I couldn't do that inside the EFA, not with the First out for my blood and SRX watching over my shoulder. So, I figured, if I want to start a war, why not join the experts?"

Kai is now less suspicious, however Lat seems more so to me now. She clearly has ulterior motives. The fact that Kai mentioned the School in the same sentence as the SRX worries me.

"No I mean, what are YOU going to do once the fighting starts?"

Kai thinks for a second. "I don't know exactly, as of right now. As I said, the main issue here is all the mystery, the way the two sides are hiding everything. Until they show their true colors, I don't know if I can just let them kill each other, or if the SRX are good people after all, or if I'll need to nudge the whole shebang here and there to make sure its a proper war.

Do ask her, though, about if she'd heard anything about the SRX project in the School. Which is doubtful, though, given the amount of secrecy surrounding it. Especially if they took as much care not to do anything unnecessary to her as she says they did, chances are they never even mentioned it.

You think for a moment, then look over at Latooni. "Subota, what do you know about these SRX guys? What do they have to do with the School?"

"Project SRX is the EFAs top mecha research and development division, combining the top levels of Mao Industries, the Radom Group, the Tronium Research Council, and many other groups. It was semi-publicly announced in the wake of Bian Zoldarks declaration, as evidence that mankind did have a response to alien threats. Beyond that, very little is known, scraps of fragments of usable data. All that is certain is that they've picked the best young pilots right out of the School, and put them in mecha that far outclass even the best PTs or AMs."

"The Top Class of the School, you say?"

Latooni frowns. "I cannot confirm it, but I beleive I was extracted by Giado and Garnet from the Cuban branch of the School the very day I was to be shipped out to Izu Base."

"Really? You didn't try to enter this grand conspiracy and see what it was all about?"

Katina can easily handle every woman at once. All she needs is lots of tentacles.

Therefore, our path is clear. We'll seduce Beowulf, and become the grand Einst overlord, and start a gigantic tentacle-loving harem with all our conquered foes-who-were-once-our-friends.

And then once we have enough women, we'll hook them all together with tentacles, and create a giant fleshy erotic human-mech and fight Dark Brain with it, and we'll out-tentacle Dark Brain into submission and add him to the harem.

Something like this. Lat is easily the most interesting and the one we have the best head start on, so we're most likely to end up with her in any way other than just rape for rape's sake. Lamia we can probably get a night or two out of, but I wouldn't count on more than that. Ibis, with the right steps, could probably become fanatically subservient to us, but I suspect she's actually going to be trickier to break in the right way for that than she looks. Beyond that, I rate our chances with anyone, male or female, to be slim and not worth spending the necessary amount of effort on. Get them on our side, but Lat should be the primary target of our rape - erm, love.

As for mechs, I concur with whoever suggested giving the now-regenerating StealthRaubiter to Lat. It shall be glorious, especially if/when we can convince Sophia to upgrade it into a custom Latgelmir. Maybe for Lat's midgame upgrade. I'm chill with DaiRaiOh being ours.

>>4553849
I'm pretty certain it was mentioned in another thread that they're the same age.

Arado also is barely a 14 year old. Remember how the crew responded to his age in OG2? The couldn't believe he was only 14 because of the enhancements the school did to him.

Also, according to Katina they were just friends, but Arado betrayed him and went off with Ouka.

Irm, meanwhile, is staring at the three of you wideeyed.

"O....kay. So, alien tentacle monsters in the EFA, then."

Kai smirks. "Glad you could catch up."

"But....well ok, I suppose it doesn't massively effect our overall plan...but man...We have got to do something..."

"Welcome to five minutes ago, Irm."

"No, I...I mean, we should just tell them."

"Who?"

"The Irregulars. Just tell them about the First and Only, and let the-"

"They can't."

"But they're not bad people, they j-"

Kai stands up off the chair. "They CAN'T, Irm. It's not about whether they want to help, its whether they can afford to, and they can't. They have to find their thingummy, or they're fucked. And we have to get them to stumble over this conspiracy, or we're fucked. That's why I'm been avoiding those bright sparks, because at the end of the day, we've gotta fuck them in the ass, for all our sakes."

Irm shakes his head. "There...there's gotta be a way..."

RESPONSE FROM KATINA?

SM!Katina is exactly the same age as OG!Katina. The SM!School's mandate is massively expanded over the OG version, and older students are not uncommon.

When exactly Katina joined the School, however, is up for debate, since that part of her memory is still gone.

Can't we ask Lune if she saw anything...weird when fighting the Cry Wolves? If they already know about the tentacle monsters it makes things a lot easier.

D'awwww, Irm is so naive, it's kind of cute.

For one, I agree with Kai. There's no need to tell the OG numbers anything, especially if we end up having to use them later.

Make Katina say the obvious.

Where are two places that could be holding Vindel? The EFA HQ and the SRW HQ. Assuming Vindel isn't in a cave somewhere, he is most likely captured and the Zweizergain is being researched. Also, if they don;t want copies of the dimensional teleporters floating around wouldn't it be better for them to defeat those who would misuse it?

Hell just lying and saying some spy in the EFA got news of something big might even be enough.

Sounds like a decent plan. It'll suck having to trick the OGverse people, though. Oh well, they probably would have had to go to one of the EFA main bases at some point.

Oh I got it.

Irm would know this.
If Lemon and Vindel were alive and uncaptured they would have let the SM or at least a W series know.

They haven't, so they must be captured or dead. Either way the Zweizergain is likely being researched at one of *places where the SM main enemies are*

The OG guys would totally buy that.

Technically, wouldn't the OG folks know already somethings not right with at least Beowulf and crew?

OG Kyosuke and Excellen saw the Einst ATX, and probably relayed to the rest. And wasn't Arado supposed to have a secret earpiece that links up to the other OGers?

Even if Kai doesn't want to tell the others, the OG folks must have some clue already.

I made calculations, and what you say is true.

Ibis starts gaining more stats per level up when she becomes confident, right.

Look:

Non-shitty guy: 10+10+10+10+10+10

Ibis: 5+5+5+15+15+15.

See? Ibis is a piece of shit.
