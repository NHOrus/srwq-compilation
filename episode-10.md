## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 10: Now shit gets real by getting super.


Welcome to the /tg/ thread with the best Fanservice Bonus to AC on /m/.

**The Plot:** After the events of OG Gaiden, Dark Brain returns and attacks the OGVerse from outside, threatening to shatter the entire dimension. Our heroes, using the XN Giest which fell through the cracks in unreality, travel to the Shadow Mirror Universe, to a point in space-time where they can prevent the Shadow Mirrors giving Dark Brain the trail he needs to find the OGverse. Their entrance to the dimension scatters the Shadow Mirrors into the dimensional void, and draws the ire of this universes EFA, who blockade them at the Tesla-Liecht Institute.

While normally we follow Shadow Mirror Katina Tarask, a psycho in a cute dress who's headed to find the missing Vindel in the company of this sexy stud, we're temporarily switching to Axel Almer, leader of what little remains of the Shadow Mirror forces, forced into a temporary alliance with the OG-Versers, even though they just destroyed his organisation and causes his leader and lover to go missing.

####SRWQ SIDE MISSION 2: THE BREAKOUT

You are Axel Almer, and you haven't had a good day.

With the EFA closing in on all sides, you've been forced to work with the mysterious other-dimensional warriors you've termed the Irregulars. The same group of warriors who are responsible for the Shadow Mirrors being destroyed, and who've admitted to you that they plan to destroy the Acqeuis system in the Zweizergain. Seeing how pointless this would be without also killing Vindel and your lover Lemon Browning, who built the system, you don't intend this plan to go ahead.

But with half the EFA fleet and several companies of PTs being landed around you, you don't have much choice but to go along with this.

The combined forces of the Irregulars and the surviving Shadow Mirrors are splitting into 4 groups, intend on a 4-way breakout before the EFA attacks. The EFA jamming is still in effect: After they leave the TLI, each group will be on its own until it gets out of the cordon.

The 4 Groups are currently:

1. The Kurogane, A Space Noah class ship with a massive drill on the bow. It plans to burrow underground and come up in the middle of the EFA lines, to distract them from phases 3 and 4 of the plan, before heading west to the Pacific. Carries a Grungust, a customized high-performance Lion, a Giganscudo variant, a white flying Gespenst with a sniper rifle, and their Beowulf in the Gespenst Mk3 (although they don't call either of them that).

2. The XN-Giest, their interdimensional travelling unit, has enough space to carry some units with it while it makes a short-range teleport and attacks the EFA from behind. It's currently carrying the Tandem Brigade, made up of fresh young pilots flying mass-produced mechs called Huckebiens. It'll then be headed south to meet up with 2 units who left to contact the DC.

3. The Hiryu Kai, a fast warship which will blitz the EFA in the north and break through with a direct assault. Carries a group of 4 unusual mechs called the SRX Team, a 'Huckebein MkIII' piloted by a manipulative bitch called Viletta, 3 Gespenst Customs, and their version of W17 in her Angelg

4. The last flyable Shadow Mirror Trilobite: Filled nearly to capacity with wounded SM pilots and technicians, who were rudely thrown out of the Lygeus portal, it also has a few vital pieces of technology onboard, but you're fairly sure its been scanned by the Irregulars a dozen times, so there'll be no surprise for them.

You have your Soulgain, not at 100% after tangling with Beowulf twice in a row but ready for a brawl anyway, and W17 in her Angelg, who's voice-chip or somesuch has been damaged, making her stutter like a skipping record.

**WHICH GROUP WILL YOU GO WITH?** The obvious choice is to stick with the surviving Mirrors, but there are other things to consider: The Kurogane has their Beowulf, who you're not sure they realise the threat of, and going west means you may meet your Beowulf, and try for round 3. The Giest is their secret weapon, and is guarded only by grunts: You could cripple their plans if you take the risk. And you have a score to settle with the crew of the Hiryu Kai. Their commanders have offered to switch a few of their units to the Trilobite: It means the wounded will be at their mercy, but you could be in a better position to get revenge. On who you're not sure.

**HOW MUCH OF A DICK ARE YOU THE READERS GOING TO MAKE THIS VERSION OF AXEL?** Will he be obsessed with Beowulf, a scheming Shadow Mirror fanatic, a petty bitter man who's lost everything, or someone who fights for a dim point of light in the future?

Neither you or they have any idea where Lemon is. The last you saw, she and Vindel disappeared in a flash of light, apparently using the last of the Zweizergains strength to escape the Irregulars. They plan to search for the Zweizergain after they've all escaped. You're not sure if they'll trust you to accompany them on the search once you've gotten out of the EFA cordon.

---

Tetsuya Onodera goes over the plan one more time. "The Kurogane strikes first in the west, followed by the Giest in the south. We suppress the EFA forces, forces them to draw back their forces. Then the Hiryu breaks north, and makes a run to the Canadian border. With the EFA lines pressed in 3 areas, Axel should be able to get his men out on the Trilobite heading west into this... desert region."

Axel smirks. "It's called the Elpis Wastes. The DC took two colonies that the EFA wrecked during the Suppression, Hope and Elpis, and sent them towards the surface to take out Geneva and Langley Base. Neither came within a hundred miles of their target, but they still caused some mighty bits of devestation. Seems your world got the soft version of the DC War..."

The tension in the meeting room increases another notch, if that were possible

"...We're not here to compare notes, Mr. Almer, we're here to save ourselves from an overzealous force that refuse to negotiate. This plan is our best chance of getting out from under their thumb with minimal loss of life on both sides."

"Yeah, I really appreciate you taking the hits so the people you wounded have the best chance of getting out. It's almost honorable of you."

Another notch.

"We start the operation in 25 minutes. Everyone, be ready."

"Th-the Trilobi-ite is fully loaded a-a-and ready to fly. My me-mech is repaired and reloaded, a-a-as is yours."

"Right, whatever." Axel brushes past W17 without so much as a glance. Damned doll was annoying enough as it was, now it's got a damned speech impediment. Lemon should have either made them properly, or not bothered to have them talk at all. "Tell the captain to change from the course those idiots are giving us. We're going southwest, not due west."

"W-w-why?"

"Oh, now you figure out how to questions orders, when you can barely talk. Wonderful. The Elpis Wastes are open ground, even the mountains aren't tall enough for cover anymore, and the EFA have filled it with sensors and boobytraps. Besides, the last report from Irm said your brothers and sisters were headed to Mehico for tequila. I figure they're worth meeting up with, for military support if not conversation.

"And, if we do swing south, theres a chance we'll get a good look at that Geist thing in action. I want to know just how well it handles itself in a fight. It could be very important in the days to come..."

The waiting is unbearable, but finally the third signal flare is sighted over the horizon: All three of the Irregular ships have engaged their targets. The Trilobites engines flare up and it boosts off, heading southwest in the desperate hope of finding a gap in the EFA lines.

"All gunners at stations?"
"Roger!"
"Torpedoes?"
"All tubes loaded with air-to-air."
"Scanners?"
"Our subsonics detect engine wakes from Tausendfuesslers, headed north. It seems to have worked, sir!"
"Don't get cocky, ensign, thats my job. Keep us low and watch for anything passing overhead. They probably have a net of planes covering the whole cordon."
"R-roger."

"M-Major-or Almer?"

"What is it, doll?"

"A-a-are we going t-to make it?"

Axel cocks an eyebrow at this. "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were concerned over your safety, W17."

"I-I have fu-fully funct-tional Self-pre-preservation routin-ines, and I cannot-t help but w-wonder if this i-is the optimal p-plan."

"...Hhmmph... Almost."

"S-sir?"

"We're the Shadow Mirrors, 17. We're meant to rattle the bars of the cage that the civilised people have locked themselves into. We're the only thing stopping the world turning into a pile of dolls, like you, unable to think for themselves, following the EFAs every whim while they jerk themselves off. We have to live, otherwise, the human race is fucked. Even if all our forces are gone, even if Vindel and Lemon are dead, if it just came down to you and me left, we'd have to fight. It's the only thing a real human can do."

"...H-hence why y-you resent a false-se human like m-me being so vital-l to Ms B-Brownings plans."

"Don't even attempt to psychoanalyse me, Doll."

The Beam of energy flashes past the two mechs sitting atop the Trilobite, and digs into the wall of the canyon behind. The EFA battleship rounds the corner and opens its mechs bays, disgorging over a dozen PTs at the Trilobite.

"So they did leave forces along the good escape routes! Well, Doll, time to practise what we preach!!"

---
```
The Soulgain and the Angelg are sitting on top of the Trilobite, because the hangar is covered in vital equipment and wounded soldiers. The Trilobite is being flown by a competent crew of redshirts, led by a nobody I'm going to call Ensign Mickey.

The two ships are at opposite ends of a rocky canyon somewhere in northern Oklahoma. You're not 100% sure theres nothing on the ground around the Canyon: Staying out of sight was kind of the point of taking this route.

The enemy is a Kestrel, a late-model Peregrine battleship modified to work in atmosphere.
```
---

"Ensign, break off and get out of here! We'll hold them...no, we'll break them!!!"

The hull plating nearly buckles as Axel kicks off the Trilobite and into the cloud of enemies, as an arrow of light takes the arm and leg off a Gespenst about to fire. The enemy scatter as the Soulgain approaches, but the blue mech twists, lands on a rock face and kicks off again, flying past another Gespenst which neatly comes apart into two pieces.

The Trilobite strains to gain altitude as another volley is fired by the Kestrel. Most of it misses the manuverable cruiser, but a salvo of missiles cracks against the port bow, the armor holding but definitely weakened.

"Keep the PTs out of the air!! As long as they're in my reach, they're basically dead!" The Soulgain shrugs off missiles and shells as it rams its fists, coated in blue fire, into an enemy Gespenst. The grunt mechs torso crumples like a coke can. But its allies pour on the fire, and Axel feels the feedback from the Soulgain, as if he were covered in fireants intend on chewing him down to the bones.

The Angelgs fires another arrow, smashing a Schutzwald's legs off, then backs off as the Kestrel boosts forward, chasing its quarry.

"Ma-major, We m-must suppress their b-b-batt-tle-"

"Just kill the damned thing already!!" Axel boosts upwards, ignoring the half-dozen Gespensts left firing wildly at him.

---
```
THIS IS YOUR ENEMY:

http://www.mahq.net/mecha/srw/og1/peregrine.htm

ITS TRYING TO GET A BEAD ON THE TRILOBITE WITH ITS MAIN GUN AGAIN. AXEL IS BELOW IT, LAMIA IS IN FRONT OF IT DODGING ANTIAIR, AND THE TRILOBITE IS MAKING A HARD TURN TO ITS LEFT.

```
---

"17, hit their bridge!" Axels jump trajectory changes through sheer force of will, and he grinds his elbow blade along the cannon's barrel, looking for a weakpoint.

"Roger-r!" Lamia types a code into her console and her bow begins to glow with ethereal energy. She is still for a few moments, allowing shells to bounce off her armor and a beam cannon shot to knock a feather off her wing. Then she releases the laser string on her bow, and the front of the Kestrel is engulfed in flames.

The Kestrel flys through the plasma cloud, gobbets of molten transparisteel flying off the armored windows, but the bridge is still there.

"Ineff-effective..."

"Well then try HARDER!!!" The Soulgains arms are a blur, grinding through the armor of the gunbarrel with fist, blade and the light of Axels passion. His fist finally bursts into one of the charged capacitors, and semi-liquid energy washes over his mechs armor. The feeling is like having ones face cut off with a sharpened icicle.

"U-understood." The Angelg boosts forward, stowing its bow and pulling its Mirage Sword, on a collision course with the enemy bridge. The turrets of the Kestrel start to track her, and beams graze the weakened frame of the Angelg, but still she flies at her objective...

The bridge of the Kestrel is torn asunder as the main cannon discharges. Half the beam lances out and strikes the space the Trilobite had been occupying 3 seconds before. The other half is thrown bursts on the Soulgain as its kick shatters the main focusing lenses. The gun assembly explodes in a hail of shrapnel, and the Soulgain is driven into the floor of the canyon by the force of the blast.

"M-major, are you al-al-alright?"

"FINE! I just need a second, keep the mechs off my back!"

"They-y have al-already been nuetral-lised."

Pulling itself out of the rock, Axel looks up to see a field of blue and off-green mechparts littering the canyon. The only thing standing is a large super robot, sheathing its blade as its cape flaps in the wind.

"The Vairose upgrade... who..."

"Glad I could help you, Major." Brooklyn Luckfield brings his mech into a deep bow. "I was attempting to liberate this prototype from enemy hands, had I known you were still alive and fighting I would have joined you earlier."

Axel grunts. "Well, you're alive, and you have a mech, that'll do for today. Now, we have to continue our escape and hope that ship didn't get a laser comm off. Ensign?"

"Sir!"

"Sink that damned thing."

The turrets of the Kestrel try in vain to target the more manuverable Trilobite as it swings around into the EFA ships rear arc. The Trilobites torpedo tubes spew smoke and the engine of the Kestrel are torn to shreds. With the Angelg, Soulgain and Vaisaga safely on its back, the Trilobite turns from the smoking hulk and jets into the sky.

---

"So, a quest, is it?" The Vysaga leans on its sword like a cane. "To rebuild our fallen kingdom and prepare once more to face the dread enemy."

"If the best the EFA can send against is stuff like that, then they're hardly a dread enemy, Luckfield." Axel sits still as possible as the Soulgain regenerates itself, but cannot help but respond to Brooklyn's commentary. "I'm far more worried about these newcomers. They may be few in number, but they have more firepower than an entire EFA fleet, and the skill to go with it."

"They certainly seem so, they certainly rattled me when I was knocked out of the Lygeus. But they seem like honorable folk, from what you say."

Axel sniffs. "Honorable or no, they're out for our blood. This small mercy means nothing, they came here to take us out and they mean to do it."

"You said they want Colonel Mauser, Major. And, if you'll allow me to be blunt, the Colonel is not the most agreeable of gentlemen. He has the blood of many an innocent on his hands. It may be that the New Shadow Mirror may be better off without him."

"And what? You're going to crown me King of Shadow Mirror, Mr I'd-call-myself-Sir-but-I'm-not-British-enough?"

"Well... I suppose that's what the quest is for, isn't it? To see if you're worthy."

"...You're way too young to talk like that. Stop bullshiting to me about quests and destiny until your beard is down to your crotch."

"As you wish." Brooklyn draws his sword and begins practising forms, while the Soulgain grows its skin back.

####SRWQ Special Mission 3: ExcellQuest

You are Excellen Browning, Sexy Mistress of the ATX Team and the best of looks and sniping prowess in any dimension. You're taking part in your most dangerous mission yet, waging war on an entire world where you know alternate versions of your dearest friends, your lover, and even yourself are running around. You're determined not to fret about this until you meet them though: Your spunky personality is vital to morale, after all.

You are travelling on the Kurogane with Irm, Leona and Tasuku, and of course the ever-studly Kyosuke Nanbu. You have just broken through the EFA lines, after a pitched battle in the Rockies where you had to teach some naughty EFA that people who act without talking first get spankings.

However, with the Jamming lessening, you can now use radar properly, and theres something flying in: Something big. The pretty white-and-blue paintjob implies its the Shirogane, captained by the stick-in-the-mud Lee Linjun, and carrying...another Kyosuke. The bad one, in the blue Alt, which grows itself back in a very familiar way.

"Maybe we can confuse them. Let's paint Kyosuke blue and have him talk to them, they'll think he's their Kyosuke!"

"...You mean paint the Alt Eisen blue, surely."

"Er, yeah, I guess that could work too."

In the comm window, Tetsuya shakes his head. "I'm fed up with all the deception and infighting. We have to give them a chance to listen to us. Eita, hail the Shirogane."
Eita nods. "Comms just barely getting through, but we have a signal."

"This is Captain Tetsuya Onodera of the Kurogane, requesting a ceasefire from the EFA forces. I beg you, give us a chance to explain ourselves!!"

"This is Captain Lee Linjun of the Shirogane Kai. The Earth Federation does not negotiate with Terrorists or Aliens, and you are suspected of being both. You will immediately surrender your vessel and submit to incarceration, or you will be fired upon."

"This is bigger than some skirmish with a terrorist cell, Le-... Captain Linjun. It's bigger than an alien invasion, its bigger than both our forces! You need to listen to us!!"

"You frightfully underestimate just how 'big' the EFA is. I'm launching my PTs now, if you don't let them land and take command of your ship you will be captured the hard way."

"Dammit Lee, don't do thi-"

Eita shouts "The transmission has been terminated!"

"...Of all the things that are different in this world, why did that have to be the same?"

Kyosuke comes back over the comms. "It looks like we'll have to do this the hard way. Everyone, prepare to launch and intercept their attackers."

---

```

>Deploy on the Alt Eisen. Let Kyosuke take the Weiss Reiter.

>Tasuku takes the Guarlion Custom, Leona the Giganscudo and Irm takes command of the kurogane.

>Let Tetsuya on the Grungust.

"Not the time for experimentation, Excellen."

"Oh come on, Kyosuke, they'll never be ready for our unconventional battle tactics!"

"They're halfway here already. Let's just deploy."

```
---

"Ok Leona, time for girl power!"

"I don't need a cheering squad, Excellen, I have Tasuku for that."

High-velocity bullets and railgun rounds tear into the EFA formation, expertly placed to hit propulsion and power systems rather than pilots. 3 Gespensts spiral to the ground spewing smoke as the others attempt to break away, firing their missiles in salvos in a desperate bid to suppress the two flying blurs.

Kyosukes voice sounds clear over the comms. "Irm, Tasuku, box them in!" The Wing Gust and the Ganduro boost in from the side, Irm flying to dodge the worst of the return fire and Tasuku soaking it up with his barrier like rain. An Eyesolid Laser disables another Gespenst, while two more are knocked flying as Tasuku charges into them.

The Alt Eisen is no less devestating, even with Kyosuke holding back. Claymore rounds in a wide burst knock three remaining Gespensts off balance. The heat horn takes the head off one, while chaingun rounds blow the knees off two others. A forth fires a clip of shells at the Riese. Three hit and barely scratch the paint. The pilebunker pierces both its arms and rips them off as trophies.

Those few EFA pilots still able to move wisely flee.

"Ok boy, why'd you have to ruin all the fun me and Leona were having? We'll never master the Suffering Sappho Attack if we keep getting interrupted."

Kyosuke looks even grimmer than usual on the comm window. "I hate to say it but you may just get your chance. That wave was just a test, they have more up their sleeves..."

The launch catapults on the Shirogane extend fully, and out fly another twelve Gespensts, these ones marked as different. The left shoulderpad is colored red, with 'ATX' written on it, the other black, with smaller text. Excellen squints, and the eye-scopes on the Howling Launcher zoom in.

"'Better is it for each one of us that he should avenge his friend, than greatly mourn.' Is that even proper english?"

"Some kind of quote, probably of the story of Beowulf. Speaking of which..."

The Blue Alt rises out of the ship, without obvious boosters helping it to stay airborne. The head rotates to view the full group. It almost seems to narrow its eyes in hate."

The voice is like Kyosukes only in the barest sense. "You copies... you chose the wrong world to pester. You might think you're hot stuff, that you can take on any odds. But here, in this worlds, only the likes of me can even pay in."

The Nacht begins to glow, an eerie light without color.

"I'm not going home today without something to show for it. Since Axel insists on being such a slippery snake. I'll take your skulls instead. ATX team... Grendel Form."

Then the change begins.

The Nachts head implodes as an armor-piercing shell travels through it at hypersonic speed, taking both cameras and the Heat Horn power conduits with it.

"I never pay attention to my Kyosuke, what makes you think I'm going to start for you??"

"Agh!! You harpy, you think I'm you're only threat? We are the First and Only, and we are ONE!!!"

The Gespensts erupt in tentacles, as horns, wings, purple eyes and more terrible pseudo-organic components form around the conventional metal.

"Th-they're turning into mini-Wiess-chans!!"

"So they do have Einst technology! Everyone be careful!!" Kyosuke starts to boost backwards firing his chaingun, as the monstrosities surge forward, firing almost-recognisable weapons.

Their M95s have grown another barrel. Their shotguns fire spear-like shards. Their Beam rifles have turned into dragon-mouthed plasma sprayers. But far more disturbing than their new gimmicks are the monstrous howls coming from the Gespensts new mouths.

Leona boosts skyward, two of the things straining to keep up as they pursue. Her railguns crack violently as she sprays fire at them, but the wet splutches they make as they hit make it unclear whether they're having much effect.

Three leap on the Ganduro, wielding their plasma cutters as the fingers of a massive claw. One forces its weapon through the barrier and makes a gouge in the big mechs flank, before being grabbed by a Sheath Anchor and promptly electrocuted.

A boost knuckle bashs one aside as another fires a shotgun into the Grungusts chest. The ultrasharp shards dissappear into nothingness just before impact, as the Final Beam sears off the Gespensts new parts, leaving it almost normal again.

One foolishly allows the Riese to get too close. The red paint bubbles off its left leg from the plasma sprayer, but the mech-thing is silenced by a single pile-bunker blow to the cockpit: The need for restraint is gone.

"Leona!! Swap dance partners!!"

"Right!!" The Seigarlion and its pursuers swing around and fly at the oncoming Wiess and its admirers. The Howling Launcher glows pink, and one can almost hear a squeal of anticipation.

"AWWOOOOWOOOOHHHH" The two Gespensts are struck by a dozen plasma bolts each in less than five seconds, as the Howling Launcher rapidfires at a rate that would melt any earth-made energy weapon. The two monstosities tumble through the air, and are finished with a point-blank shot each.

"Sonic Acceleration!" The four Gespensts are knocked assunder as the Seigarlion crashes through them. One is singled out and rammed again, riding the bow-wave field down half a mile before crunching into the side of a mountain as Leona pulls up.

"Giga Burst!!" The two clawed Gespensts are blasted off the Ganduro, one arcing straight into the Grungust and being bisected by the Keitou Ragouken, the other being unceremoniously impaled on the Revolver Bunker.

"Well, so much for the scary aliens from beyond the stars!"

"Excellen!"

"What?"

The Nacht and the Weiss impact on the Rockies at close to Mach 0.7. Fleshy cushions in the Wiess's cockpit inflate with fluid, protecting Excellen from the force of impact, but the mech itself is unresponsive, and is dragged to its feet by the Nacht, the Howling Launcher held against its own throat.

"You... you're the worst..."

"Ugh... Kyosuke..." The feedback from the Rien Wiessritter has never felt like this before. This time, Excellen is actually feeling Wiessy's... pain. How is he doing this??

"You're so close to us. Your body is like ours, and so is your mech, but I can taste your betrayal. The death of your own emperor, I can smell it off you."

"Shut... up..." Excellen points her beam cannons at the misshapen head, but from somewhere, tentacles grab the Wiess's arm, and both legs.

"So pitiful, trying to live in their world when you're so much more. You...I can barely stand to touch you."

"Coulda fooled me..." The tentacles start to squeeze, and Wiess's buckled armor starts to crack.

"We cast you out, unclean sister. The First and Only call you anethaema, break all connections and fusions, and sentence you to the End with the humans you have joined."

"You... you're nothing like my Kyosuke..."

"What gave that away? The fact that I'm a minor god compared to that monkey?"

"No... it's how you're afraid to get intimate!"

Tentacles burst from the Wiess's frame and dig into those of the Nacht. Nerves are severed and spliced together, and for a fleeting moment, the minds of Excellen Browning and the thing called Beowulf are connected.

Niether enjoys the experience.

"BLAAAAAARGGHH!!! YOU BITCH!!" The Nacht tears itself off Wiess and flies itself into a cliff-face, lolling like a drunk. "YOU'RE POISONING ME!! YOU'RE POLLUTING MY MIND WITH YOUR FILTHY MONKEY SOUL!!! GET OUT!! GET AWAY!!"

"You're right. It just wouldn't work out between us."

The Howling Launcher splits and expands, growing two new barrels as it whines with the lust for vengeance. The half-human scream as the Nacht's crotch is vaporised is exactly what Excellen wanted to hear.

"ARRRRGGHH!!! Not yet! I am of the First and Only, and I am Life and Death."

"No. You're just a cheap imitation."

The Reise slams into the Nacht, the heat horn digging into its chest in a spurt of purple fluid. The Claymore Launchers open and a cloud of shrapnel launches the blue monster into the air. A final boost, and the Riese uppercuts the Nacht, the Pilebunker fires, and the Nacht flies end over end, trailing shrapnel and gobbets of pseudoflesh, and rolls down the mountain into the rapids of the Missouri.

"This is the Kurogane. The enemy flagship is retreating from the combat area. No enemy signatures detected. Prepare for recovery."

The battered but unbroken heroes head back to their ship, intent on leaving this cursed battlefield of horrors behind.

"...Excellen, you're being awful quiet."

"I know Kyosuke... I'm just trying to figure out, what it was Wiess and me saw when we connected to his... that things mind."

Kyosuke sets his jaw. He'd never really worried himself over the nature of this hybrid machine his lover piloted, but now it had hurt her, inadvertedly perhaps, even as it saved her. The questions he'd surpressed squirmed just below the surface, but he kept them down, for now.

"What... what did you see? Did you learn something about the Einst of this world?"

"I... sorta... kinda. The thing is, I'm not sure, what I saw inside that man, that you could call it an Einst the same as what we fought. It was different in so many ways... and it could be much more dangerous."

---

Hours later, the test type Gespenst MkIII, in its blue rollout paintjob, surfaces from the river a hundred miles west of Kansas city. It lifts itself into the air and lands on the deck of the Shirogane, riding the launch elevator down.

Inside, 12 Gespensts stand in pristine condition, their black and red shoulderpads brunished like they were fresh from the factory. Only a few scraps of metal and organic detritus on the hangar floor indicated that hours before, these mechs had been spread across the Rockies like peanut butter on bread.

"Well Gentlemen, it seems we've hit a snag."

No sound comes from the immobile mechs.

"No, the Commitee have planned for this. We knew there'd be threats like this, ever since Date completed her damned SRX and humiliated us in the Inspectors War. We are prepared. Your training will be of great use in your new forms."

Silence once more.

"Linjun!! Get this crate moving, back to Geneva. We must begin Project Zeitgiest, at once!!!"
