# Episode 09

##SRWQ Mission 9: I can count me.

The continuing adventures of Shadow Mirror Katina Tarask, the psychotic dress-wearing sex offender who adventures in a world being torn apart by the invasion from the OGverse.

####Dramatis Personae
(Most of you should know their personalities by now)

+ Katina Tarask: Piloting RaiOh
+ Irm: Piloting Assault Lander
+ Russel: Piloting Blue Gespenst with Blade Tonfas
+ Latooni: Currently without a mech.
+ Ibis: Piloting red Gespenst loaded down with guns.
+ Kai: Currently without a Gespenst.
+ OGverse Arado: Currently without a mech.
+ Dumi: Pilot/AI for DGG-04
+ Engineering Corp/Trilobite crew: Rio, Ryoto, and Johnathan Kazahara.

The Trilobite has space for 3 more PT-sized units, but can easily take another 50 crew.

---

The Trilobite has lifted off under Dumi and Ryoto's control, and is headed for the coordinates given by the last transmission of Unit W, on the coast of Mexico. It's after midnight at this point, and you haven't slept since well before you arrived at TLI yesterday.

There's no sign of Latooni or Arado coming to your room.

You go to sleep, and dream dreams of the main cast naked while you shoot down planets with a sword.

---

###ELSEWHERE AND TOTALLY NOT IN A PSYCHIC DREAM

Yukiko Date rests her hands on her chin, here eyes hidden by the shine of her glasses. "Your report is noted, Major Shine. I commend you on its speed and accuracy."

Shine looks sheepishly at the ground at her feet. "This battle... its not going to count against my record, is it? I mean, it wasn't normal circumstances, I was outnumbered and-"

"The encounter will be noted in your record as survival against unexpected and unusually powerful odds. That is sufficient this time, due to the intelligence gathered, but for your next mission, I expect far better."

"...Yes Sir."

"The main body of the EFA is about to begin an operation to capture TLI and these Irregular forces. We've been completely excluded from participating, and the comms blackout prevents our other agents from giving us more info." Date stands up and manipulates the controls on her comm module. "Regardless of the results of the EFA operation, we need better intel of our own. An observer in California reports a Shadow Mirror battleship landing at the DC base, restocking, and taking off towards Mexico. The probability that they know more is too great to ignore."

Date sits down again. "I'm assigning R-Blade Unit 3 to you. Be more careful with it than with the Schwein, its our last one. You'll also be escorted by Squad 27, and the Black Knight. Follow this battleship, pick up its trail, and capture it or a member of its crew by any means nessecary."

Shine salutes. "I am the Princess of the Future. I have already completed my mission."

Date nods. "I'll hold you to that. Now go."

---

You are awoken by a knock on your door, as Ibis tells you to get to the bridge. You dress hurriedly, angry that you can't fix your ribbons properly, but glad that Ryuune provided you with some clean clothes.

The mood in the bridge is sombre. Kai nods as you come in. "Now that we're all here, heres the situation: Unit W has been running non-stop since they left TLI yesterday, with the EFA on their tail the whole way. They managed to get to a port on the coast and were securing ocean transport to Brazil, when they came under attack from the Wet Navy, of all things. They sunk two cruisers but their ship and most of the boats at the port were damaged. They've been beseiged in the town ever since.

"Theres an EFA Squad advancing on their position as we speak. They report 11 Gespensts, 2 Schutzwalds, and a wing of StealthRaubtiers circling over head. They only have minimal forces, apparently they're low on pilots.

"We have to break that cordon and get them out of there. But without a crew, the Trilobite can't fight: It'll have to be a mech battle."

---

###ELSEWHERE AGAIN

Kirk Hamill frowns at the report. "This is impossible on all accounts. A Huckebien-type, a high-end Lion variant, and an R-Gun Powered piloted by one of our old pilots? This can't be right..."

Yukiko continues looking out over her desk, chin on hands. "If she'd been lying, I'd know. Plus the data gathered from the Schwein confirms it. The unit data is within the expected parameters and the R-Gun pilots voice-print match perfectly to Mai Kobayashi."

"The R-Gun is one of our greatest secrets, even more than units 1, 2 and 3 and the SRX itself! There's no way the plans could have been leaked to another group, and they certainly wouldn't have the Tronium!"

"And yet, Hamill, that appears to be exactly what has happened. That cannot be denied. Either we have a leak, or this group has been able to extract the data from outside our base. Either way, we have to recapture this unit and any other they before the EFA engage it. If they get any more combat data on the R-Series, they may finally realise exactly what we're capable of."

Kirk Hamill sighs. "Unit BP... It won't be ready for another few months. If its stopped now..."

"Bump all SRX units up an alert level and have Intelligence check for any breach on the R-Gun. And find me some more agents. We need to track down each and every one of these Irregulars, now."

---

Russel suggests that Kai takes his Gespenst, but the eyepatched veteran will have none of it. "Commanders privileged, my boy, I stay here and direct you, same as Irm. Latooni will take the Assault Lander."

Ibis looks crestfallen.

Russel is still concerned. "What about strategy? Are we just going to run around shooting wildly? Shouldn't each person have a notion of what they're doing?"

"For a unit as small as this, in a builtup environment, its often down to individual initiative from the troopers on the ground. Besides, I haven't seen how you guys fight yet. I wouldn't be much help ordering you to do things you're not skilled at."

With nothing left to discuss, you head to your mechs.

Arriving on the scene, you see the town has been half demolished, and civilians run everywhere trying to escape the charnel pit that was their home. The Trilobite goes hull-down behind a ridge, and opens its topside and rear hatches. You and Dumi fly out, followed by Ibis and Russel, while Latooni drops to the ground and drives off to find a position to give support fire from.

From here, you can see a group of 3 Gespensts and a Schutwald in a park in the middle of town, and 2 of the three StealthRaubtiers flying in from the north.

---
```
It's a port town, large docks to the east, you're in the west. Theres a central district with taller buildings which you think might be occupied by one side or the other. There are two open parks, one containing enemy forces, the other containing a Hippo Mass Transport, a modified version of a DC Rhino Land Battleship that has no front blade and better guns. You're guess this is Unit Ws ride.

As for cover, you're in a 50 meter tall flying super robot. The only way you'll hide yourself is by joining Latooni in the mountains. The largest intact building in the town comes up to your mechs chest, and is half the width.
```
---

"OK! Dumi, cover us, we're going for those enemies in the park. Let's do it!"

*Roger!*

The entire group charges at the EFA formation. You soon see shells, beams and missiles flying at you as they turn around. Dumi flies ahead, the wheel-pods on his shoulders glowing with energy, and as the enemy fire focuses on you, it is absorbed by a field of smoky energy in front of him.

"Yeah!! You bitches have nothing on Dumi!"

*Do not be complacent. Watch from the side!*

A beam shot mars your leg armor, and another your shoulder, as the two StealthRaubtiers open up on your flank. Transforming scout PTs based on a modified Gespenst design, their fighter modes are incredibly swift and hard to detect, making them difficult opponents if not the most dangerous. However, the two break off as Ibis and Russel open fire on them, giving you your chance.

"Ok, opening up the plasma converter, lets show them what they're up against. LIGHTNING FAAAAALLLL!!!!"

The Raioh slams into the ground right in front of the Schutzwald, but its still easily close enough. The artillery mech is launched into the air by the detonation of plasma, and crashes into a nearby library, its half-melted limbs flying in all directions as the stresses crumple the suit into so much scrap. The three Gespensts are knocked over by the cloud, the paint peeling off in the heat as the pilots fight to retain control of the damaged mechs without passing out.

"Katina, We're coming in too suppo-"

"I CAN'T HEAR YOU, I'M KICKING TOO MUCH ASS!!!"

The Plasma Leaders on the Raioh's arms light up, and two whips of lightning snake out and grab two of the stricken Gespensts, before throwing them into the air and slamming them back down into the third. The crunch of metal and screams of the pilots are quite invigorating.

"AH!" Russels shout draws your attention from the slaughter, as you can see the Raubtiers have gotten a direct hit on him. His Gespenst is intact, but appears to be losing power, and altitude, while the Raubtier squad, now three strong, turn at Ibis.

*Katina, another enemy force detected. They're attempting to flank the Hippo.*

"Dumi!! Subota!! Get to the Hippo! I'll take these gnats!!!" You leap into the air, the world inverting underneath you.

"RISING METEOR!!!" The Raioh leaps into the air in a column of flame. Windows across the town shatter from the heat. You pass through the formation of Raubtiers as they swing around to focus on Ibis. They break off as the plasma cloud passes close by, but one seems to be crippled, heading to earth in much the same way as Russel.

PLASMA OVERLOAD. CONVERTOR STRAIN CRITICAL. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN.

*Katina, you've used too much of the Raiohs plasma energy in too short a space of time. It needs time between attacks to cool down. Give it at least 15 seconds before attacking again.*

"I have to land first." You shout, as the failing thrusters try desperately to slow your descent.

The StealthRaubtier, much like the Wildraubtier, is a light and maneuverable mech, and at 55 tons is easily able to maneuver under the force of its engines and tesla drive.

The Raioh, at over 120 tons, requires a Plasma Conversion Reactor rated higher than the average power plant just to maintain constant flight.

You crash into the little scout PT like an eagle pouncing on a sparrow, and the effect is much the same except the cloud of feathers is made of meter-long pieces of shrapnel. You hit the ground a few seconds later, deepening the first crater you made and jostling you in your seat, while obliterating the little PT as a functional piece of matter.

Russel's wounded tesla drive sets him down relatively smoothly a few meters behind you. "Jaysus, lass, I thought we were coming here to get new mechs. With this kind o' carryon we won't be getting anything but souveniers."

"Yes!!" you hear Ibis shout, as the fusillade of shells from her dual-wielded M95s clips another Raubtier and sends it into a death-dive. The final one breaks off and heads to the north. "It's getting away! Will I pursue?"

"Nah, get to the Hippo! I'll take him!" With the indicators on the Raioh barely out of the red, you blast off into the sky again. It's actually a really fast mech for its size, it just can't turn on a dime like others can.

The Raubtier dodges wildly as you send out constant streams of energy from your hands. He dives under one and over another, always staying just a fraction of a meter far enough away to avoid the magnetic field that would spell his doom. Your indicators approaching the redline again, you curse and throttle back, launching twin Harken Impulse shots. One just manages to clip a wing, and the whole mech flips over, the pilot ejecting.

You land again, the indicators screaming once more. From here, you can see Latooni's fire coming from the mountains and smashing into the town, each shell either crushing a building or knocking a Gespenst out of cover and into the firing line of your allies. But they're still fighting, and in one last push, 3 Gespensts and a Schutzwald rush from behind a collapsing building, a last desperate charge at where Ibis and Dumi are guarding the Hippo.

"Damn stupid Plasma Convertor!! Just because I want to lay waste to half the planet doesn't mean you get the right to crap out on me when your components start to melt!!"

As you're running, Dumi is being assaulted. His barrier blocks shot from the Schutzwald while he draws his Ridols from their arm slots and blocks the EFA Gespensts engaging him in melee. One goes for a Jet Magnum but is just barely dodged, while another opens up at pointblank range and scores some hits before the gun is slashed in two along with its hand. The Third take a split missile from Ibis to the gut and falls over, the pilot dead from his cockpit imploding.

Dumi slashes at his attackers and disables one with a double stab, but this leaves him open and he takes a Jet Magnum to the gut. The DGG-04 staggers back from the blow, and is then knocked over as another Schutzwald shot collapses its shield. The Gespenst, seeing its chance, leaps at the fallen super before Ibis can react...

The massive oversized shell goes straight through the Gespensts armor and into its reactor, detonating the whole 60-ton mech into a cloud of fragments, as the Schutzwald taked an AP round to the cockpit, and slumps to the ground.

The Rathgriths F-Solid Bazooka folds back over its back. "All enemies accounted for. Mission accomplished with 60% of our assets intact."

Dumi raises himself to his feet. *My thanks for the assistance. You're the last survivor of Unit W, I'll have to assume?*

"That's not strictly accurate. The battleship's mech complement was being piloted by normal pilots, I'm the only member of Unit W able to deploy. I'm W16, but you may call me Echidna if that's more convenient."

You finally arrive at the scene, resting your overtaxed mech next to the crushed remains of a Shadow Mirror Gespenst. "Wait, so this big elite squad of hush-hush pilots couldn't even get into mechs to literally save their own lives?"

"The remainder of the W-series is currently in containment, and getting them out of containment is not a trivial task. It was more efficient to keep them in storage and await your arrival than to risk damaging them in a rushed procedure."

"Even at the cost of all these pilots lives??"

A short pause. "I had my orders from Miss Browning. Now, I reccommend we transfer surviving crew and supplies to your ship. We need to evacuate as soon as possible."

---

The crew of the Hippo look shattered from constant attacks and lack of sleep, but are still more than happy to strip their old vessel and move things onto the Trilobite. Ammo, parts, and spare missiles are conveyored over using the cargo equipment of the two ships. Also being transferred, as gently as possible, are a dozen odd containers, marked with 'Wxx' designations.

"These are Unit W?" asks Irm, his brow furrowed. "I was expecting, y'know... people."

Echidna doesn't bat an eyelid at this. "The W-Series are reconstructed humans, formerly dead or crippled subjects used as the framework for a new type of soldier. Some, like myself, are rebuilt to operate as a normal human. Others are confined to the pods, awaiting direct connection to the operating system of a mech."

Irm looks like he doesn't know quite what to make of that.

You observe the transfer of the W-Series to the medical bay of the Trilobite, trying in vien to peep through the red glass. One capsule, labelled W-BC-01, looks a little different to the others.

"Please, Lt. JG. That capsule only recently arrived at TLI and Ms. Browning was making it her top priority after the jump. I can't have you disturbing it."

"I wasn't touching it, I was just loo-"

~~You killed me, Katina...~~

Irm puts a hand on your shoulder. "Ugh, Katina are you alright?"

"I AM ABSOLUTELY FINE. I AM GOING TO LEAVE YOU VERY NICE PEOPLE TO YOUR WORK NOW. IF YOU NEED ME I'LL BE HIDING IN THE CLOSET."

Irm watches you scamper off, utterly confused once more.

```
REAL CREW GET.
FULL AMMO RELOAD GET. The shells for the Hippo guns fit into the Assault Lander, thankfully.
NEW PILOT: ECHIDNA ISAKKI
BATTLESHIP CREW SET
CHOOSE NEW UNITS:

You have the option of fitting 3 more units into your hangar. There are multiple options for this:

Echidna's Rathgrith

Any number of Gespenst MkII-Ms. Most are trashed but a few need only minimal repair.

The last of the EFA steath fighters miraculously managed to land on its belly after coming out of the roll, even without its pilot. It'll need an overhaul, and the stealth coating is melted off from the Raioh attacks, but you can easily get yourself a fully functional MP WildRaubtier.

The Schutzwald that Echidna cored with her saviour shot can be fixed using a Gespenst cockpit block.

Finally, the Hippo had a few other units in its hangar that its defenders decided not to use: A Guarlion Custom, and a Soldifar Assault Dragoon, an ELF-made unit that the Shadow Mirror used to create their Ashsaber series.

The MP Wildraubtier won't suddenly crumple like a paper cup in a vise if you try to transform at high speed, for one. The performance and firepower are the same as the OG version, they just made more, and developed the tech to make them more reliable.

Same with the multiple Schutzwalds running around: I'm going on the theory that since the SMverse EFA really developed the Gespenst, then other PT models would also see a bigger production run, since the do-everything Huckebiens never saw play.

And its the Soldifar, not the Ashcleef.

Dammit, in all the excitement, I kinda forgot to mention what shape the Hippo was in.

It's not UNsalvagable, but it took hits to the Tesla hovercraft system and its main guns on the top of it. It would need several hours of maintenance to get it operational again, but Echidna told them it wasn't worth it, to just get everything ready to transfer to the Trilobite.

As to the Assault Lander: The main reason she hasn't been doing so well is that she hasn't been in battles where her main strengths lie. Its an Assault unit, as the name says, meant to bombard, missile spam, and drill its way through enemy forces. So far, its been in two fights: One against hyper-dodgy real robots, and another a rescue mission to support faster units trying to get to trapped allies. Latooni got 3 or 4 offscreen kills in that fight, but she was only using the main cannons. Irm would probably have charged straight into the town and drilled his way through all the building to take the enemy pointblank. If Irm wasn't the only member of the team with a fully working conscience, anyway.

The Assault Lander is a test-type, limited run unit based on the Grungusts Gustlander mode. It was an attempt to get some mileage out of the Grungust line after the EFA turned down the Grungust Mk2. It uses a light-wieght version of the original Cracker Engine, and mounts heavy cannons, an expanded missile magazine with 4 launchers, and a Titanic Drill with Spiral Attack functionality.

It's meant for fortress assault at all ranges: Suppress the fortress at long range, missile spam at close range, then switch to the drill and dig the foundations out from under it.

It's not Getter 2 but it can travel underground at a fairly impressive rate.

Ammo is a problem however. It uses battleship-grade shells and missiles in quite substantial amounts.

Look for other ships in the city

This would have been a great idea a few hours, when this was a bustling port town. Indeed, this is exactly what the Hippo crew were doing. Then the EFA Wet Navy came along and started shelling the Hippo and the port around it. When they realized they were losing, the last EFA ship torpedoed all the heavy transports out of spite. Or at least, thats the story the Hippo crew are giving you.

We shall leave it in the Hippo in a relatively hidden spot.

The only spot that even remotely hidden that the crippled Hippo can get to on its own steam is the Ocean. You can load with unwanted units, seal it up, and set it to crawl out to see to a depth the EFA won't find it. It's a risk and it'll be a bitch to retrieve afterwards, but its your best option if you want to store shit for later.

Funds and parts are mainly a game abstraction. I'm being flexible here but your main problem up until now has been time and manpower. You were overworking John, Rio and Ryoto just to keep your mechs working. Now that you have some actual people to use and a little more free time, you can start making suggestions to customize your units. But major changes will need the right engineer behind them.

Current Mech Roster:
DGG-03 - Katina
DGG-04 - Dumi FIXED
Bluepenst With Tonfas - Russel
Redpenst - Irm takes this, claiming he likes the sturdier, reliable mech to flimsy stuff like the Guarlion.
Greenpenst - Kai has put dibs on this one, and asked for a spare Jet Magnum arm too. He claims to have a plan.
WildRaubtier - None right now
Soldifar - Latooni wants to try out this.
Guarlion - Arado is being entrusted with this.
Rathgrith - Echidna
Schutzwald - Ibis, although she claims she prefers solid shot weaponry, and is looking longingly at the Rathgrith.

```
---

The Hangar door seals itself shut, locking away the Assault Lander and a large pile of broken Gespensts. As the automatic program kicks in, the wounded Hippo slowly turns, and heads out to sea, sinking into the depths.

You're currently a pilot short, although Echidna says she can fix that, if you give her some time in the medical bay without any distractions.

---

You find Irm and Latooni in the hangar, next to the new Soldifar.

"Are you sure you want to try out something like this? I thought you were an artillery specialist."

"My main offensive strength is precision weapons fire at all ranges. Douglas is an artillery specialist, focusing on suppressing the enemy with heavy weapons. I would prefer a mobile mech with beam weaponry, like this one or the Raubtier."

"Ok, I guess we all have our preferences... Oh hey Katina... er... What's up?"

"I... I just want to say sorry for how I've been acting. I know its been hard on all of you to put up with me, and it means we haven't come together as a team the way we should, and I really want to make up for it."

Irm once again proves critically vulnerable to your moeface. "Oh... Oh, Katina, don't worry about it. We realize that things are difficult for you, with your condition and all. But the important thing is, you know whose side you're on, and you're trying your best to help us. With Dumi watching out for you, you should be fine. We'll all help you get through this."

"Th-thank you, Irm-kun. And Subo... Latooni... you can have this back." You hand her back the ribbon. "I'm sorry I... just, sorry."

Latooni takes back the ribbon gingerly, her face expressionless as she adjusts her glasses. "Whatever. You should see to your mechs maintenance, and ask the AI to tell you how to pilot it. You'll never improve if you end up burning to death in a melting pile of slag." With this, she hops down the gantry stairs and heads for the bridge.

Irm blinks after her. "Frankly, Katina, this pack of misfits has mental issues all round."

---

"K-k-k-katina! H-how are you today? Feeling... mellow, maybe." Arado's brow beings to drip sweat.

"Oh Arado, I'm so sorry if we got off to the wrong foot. It's just... I have a history, when I was at the School. I knew... this worlds Arado, and we were close. Then, he died at the School, and I haven't been the same since. I sort of pushed all my feelings for him onto you, and that wasn't fair. I guess, maybe it'd be better, if we started afresh."

"Oh... Oh, alright, if you put it that way... But, if you don't mind me saying, aren't you like, 25?"

"Th-thats not old! I'm not old! The School even takes old women sometimes!"

"No, I'm just saying, I'm 16, so I assume my counterpart would be as well, and well, the difference in ages is a bit-"

"Wh-what are you implying??"

"Well, I'm just saying, its a bit-"

"It wasn't like that!!! We were friends!! It was him who had the thing for older women, not me!! And he was the one who went for that slut Ouka!! JUST WHEN I NEEDED HIM THE MOST!!"

You run off, teary-eyed, leaving Arado in possibly the worst state of shock yet.

"OUKA?? But that... I wouldn't... OUKA???"

Hours remaining 6

---

After drying your eyes, you head to the back of the hangar, where Rio and Dumi appear to be having a conversation over the Raioh, Ryoto and Kai are having an argument at the new Gespenst, and you see Johnathan Kazahara in the corner, absent-mindedly tapping at a datapad and looking forlorn.

"Er, Doctor Kazahara?..."

Johnathan looks up. "Ah, if it isn't our resident firebrand. Whats a vibrant young thing dealing with an old fart like me for? Not that I mind..."

"Erm, its just... you're looking really lonely in the corner, I just wanted to know if everything was alright."

With these words, you can see Johnathan visibly deflate, and he seems to age ten years. "I... I'm just feeling quite lonely right now."

"Lonely... Oh, the TLI, you worked there, didn't you? You must have lost a lot of friends yesterday..."

"You know, the funny thing is, I really didn't. TLI hasn't been home for me for a long time, every since Rob, Kirk, and Marion all left. Back in the days of the Grungust, when we were building the greatest robots on earth together, the place really seemed alive to me. But then the Mk2 was cancelled, and all my friends were cherry-picked and dragged away to different EFA projects. The TLI became practically a ghost town, until Dr. Albark showed up, and started making the Earthgain series. Then we managed to convince ourselves we needed to make some kind of stand, and we fell in with Shadow Mirror, trying to see if they could use our expertise to some kind of good."

He tosses the datapad aside and rubs his face in his hands. "But through it all, I've really been sleepwalking through it all, letting things slip out of my fingers because I can't summon the urge to hold onto them. Now everything is gone, basically, the Grungusts are scrap, the Assault Landers at the bottom of the sea, if the EFA had scrapped that Fortress Wing prototype we sold them I wouldn't be shocked in the slightest... Pretty much everything I've worked at in life has fallen down the drain, except Irm. Say what you will about him, he believes in fighting the EFA and bringing back freedom. Least an old fart like me can do is try to help him out."

He lets out a long, weary sigh.

"Well... maybe the best way to help him would be to make him a new Grungust!"

Johnathan looks up at this. "What?"

"Well, its pretty obvious Irm likes piloting super robots, given the way he keeps complaining about the lighter mechs. I'd bet if we got him one, he'd be really over the moon!"

"That's a nice thought, Katina, but I don't have a lot to work with. The Type 0 was smeared over the Nevada desert along with its test pilot. Of the three Type 1s, two were dismantled to power the Lygeus, and the third was at Mao Industries and got stolen by the Inspectors. We only got one Type 2 made, which should be sitting in a hangar in Langley Base. The Type 3 was barely a frame, the Shadow Mirrors were going to finish it once they got to the new world. All the spinoffs and spare parts were either lost with TLI or given to the EFA to keep them distracted from the Earthgains and Vairoses we were making."

"And the newcomers brought two."

"...Really? I didn't see that at all. Wow... what if one of those has another Irm on it, that could get awkward..."

"But you basically designed the Grungust from the ground up! Surely there must be something you can use to make one."

Johnathan shakes his head. "Not in the back of an overgrown flying shellfish, at the very least. I'd need heavy-duty parts to act as the frame, and a power source with the same power output as a Cracker Engine or greater. Those types of things, you don't find lying around. And even then, starting from scratch, it'd take months."

"Well, maybe we can't build one right now, but once we get to Africa, we'll have all of Van Trans factories to use!"

"Well, maybe-"

"And we can start making guerilla raids on EFA bases, see which of them have super robot parts we can use, and get some contruction equipment."

"Wouldn't that be a little too risky just fo-"

"Ooh!! Once the Newcomers leave the TLI, we might be able to sneak back in! We can grab the parts we need there!"

"Do you really think they'll just leave th-"

"We might have to use new weapons, based on PT ones, to replace the more extravagant stuff. Like a giant Jet Magnum, or a massive rifle that another pilot flies like a ship!"

"Thats quite an ambitious idea..."

You spend the next several hours with Johnathan, discussing plans both crazy and worryingly feasible.
