# Episode 30

##SRWQ Mission 30: Goddammit guys, we don't even need trolls anymore!

In our last, relatively content-light thread (seriously, what have I spawned that causes so much discussion?), Katina and company arrived back on Earth, at a secret location in China where the Junkers Faction and the Earth' Liberation Front were meeting. Most of the team began paying their blood-money to the DC for destroying their space base, while Katina wandered off to help a construction worker called Rand to pull an ancient lion-shaped mechanoid out of the ground. Unfortunately, it turned out the thing was infested with Einst tentacles, so Katina bravely electrocuted it (and Rand) in the middle of the DC camp, then ran screaming at the next mechanoid. This caused a bit of confusion.

While the other factions finally realise that somethings up other than Katina, she is wrestling a giant snake-thing, which threatens to crush her in its coils. Meanwhile, Dumi, in his new ship form, heads for the Zweizergain, the cause of and solution to most of the Shadow Mirrors problems.

---

Adrenaline pumps into your system as you scream your fury at the Snake "FUCK YOU!! IF YOU WON't FRY, YOU'LL BUUUUURRRNN!!!" You swing the whole mech around several times and toss it into the air. The tail wrenchs out of the back of the Raioh, squirting some kind of liquid. The Raioh glows red and leaps into the air, its legs aflame.

"RISING METEOR!!!"

You kick the snake, hard. Chunks of purple armor and green psuedoflesh fly everywhere. Then you turn on a dime, and kick it again. And again. And again.

The flaming ruin crashes down into the side one of the bulk transports meant to transport the Bartols, leaving a massive dent. Its still trashing about however, and the green pesudopods are emerging from the wounds, waving about in some pattern you don't quite recognise.

Well this has gone well. You turn and see Dumi, suspending the Zweizergain from some kind of energy beam, and surrounded by ELF forces. A dozen Soldifars, a Vairose and a Simurgh Splendid are all aiming their weapons right at him.

"Dumi! Teleport the Zweizergain away! Send it back to Axel!"

*I'd need to drop my shields to do that! Could you maybe give me a few seconds distraction?*

You hurredly switch comm channels to ELF frequencies. "Hey, you guys, what do you think you're doing!?! We need to get out of here, like now, no time to fight each other!"

A direct comm comes from the Simurgh, and a young womans face appears in the window. "Yes, it might seem so, but it'd be typical of you Shadow Mirrors to try to turn this chaos to their advantage. You haven't been here twenty minutes, and you've managed to turn this whole enterprise into a debacle just to get your leader back! I don't know how you sabotaged the mechanoids, but if you think you're going to simply walk away from this with everything you want, you're mistaken girl!"

"I don't give a shit about Mauser! Chuck the bastard in the holes with those monsters for all I care! We just need the Zweizergain, just to keep it away from the EFA! We ALL need to escape! Shuu! Shuu, get the Granzon warmed up!!"

*The Granzon's teleportation isn't stable when transporting dimensionally active materials like those in me and the Zweizergain. I'll have to use my own transportation abilities.*

A hundred voices ring across the comm frequencies. "You're not going anywhere. You seek to destroy the future, the salvation of mankind through our union." The Bartols fill the air, pointing guns at everyone, even the ELF, even other DC units. "You will all stand down, and the ODE system will see the truth."

"You dumbass, Juergen!" You point over at the Snake, which is picking itself up, green tentacles once again forming purple armor. "THAT is the real threat!! It called the EFA, it's bringing the fucking Beowulves. And you're pointing guns at me?? ME??"

The hundred voices come again. "I am not Juergens, I am all within the ODE system. I act as one, but am many. And we have seen what you will do if left alone, far worse than one beast could possibly do."

As if in retort to that, the snake begins spraying acid into the air. You dodge away, a few drops sizzling against your armor, but several Bartols simply melt. The retribution is swift and fierce, and the Snake dissappears in a haze of missiles and beams.

More shaking, and the snail erupts from the ground, tentacles forming a cannons on its shell. Something like a bats wing comes from another hole. Lily Junkers screams down the comms. "Hamills mechanoids have gone crazy!!! Juergens, stop being an idiot and get those Bartols into the transports!!!"

You boost through the melee towards Dumi, dodging stray shots. "He's not going to listen! He... they've gone mad! Dumi, shut them down again! Or show me how to do it!"

*Too late. They're here.*

The thirteen Gespensts, each leading a dozen of what look like giant alien skeletons. The black one at the fore hefts its F2W cannon.

"Well well..." Says the voice of Albero Est. "I figured it'd be you guys, somehow."

"Dumi! Leave with the Zwei, NOW!!! Shuu, get the rest of us. Everyone, form u-"

The Gespenst Kai boosts past, headed straight at the EFA lines.

"Oh no!!! You don't get to die gloriously on my watch!!!" You boost after Kai."

*Katina!!*

"Just go! Come back for me in a minute or two, I'll have a decent kill-count by then!"

You boost forward through the chaos, swatting Bartols out of the way as you go. They may have learned how to avoid direct attacks from you, but they're focused on the mechanoids and haven't learned to avoid being blindsided.

Then a much larger shape gets between you and the First and Only forces.

"You!!" shouts Rand. "What the hell do you think you're doing, zappin' me like that?!? If Mail'd been in here, she could have been killed!!"

The new half-mechanoid, half-construction mech brandishes a ridiculously massive wrench at you. It seems the pilot is none the worse for wear after his mech was eaten by one of them.

"I wasn't zapping you, I was killing the bad alien stuff in that wreck we were lifting! Look at the other monsters, and what happened to your mech when I burned out all the bad parts of it!"

"That was still pretty goddamn reckless! I'm still all tingly!"

"Man the fuck up!! We've got bigger shit to worry about! My pal Kai is going to get killed out there!"

"...Kai? Kai who?"

"THE Kai Kitamura, bitch! And you know if he needs help, shit has gotten real!"

"Yeah, I DO know. Man, what a time for a reunion!"

"Reun... You're Rand Travis!! The Motherfucking Crusher!! Oh fuck, why didn't I get a proper autograph book??"

"Don't call me that!! Now, let's see about Kai."

You follow the Ex-Agressor into battle, where you can see Kai and Albero already trading blows...

---

*Trilobite 1, come in.*

"DGG-04, we read you. What is your reentry vector?"

*I've already landed, 50 klicks west-southwest. I need to talk with someone in command, urgently!*

"Do you need pickup? Are you damaged?"

*No, just get me Axel or Irm. And make sure they know that the Irregulars and the DC cannot know about this. What I have here could change everything.*

Kar-Wai blinks in the harsh sunlight. "I thought you were taking us to the jungle, not the desert, Mr Shirakawa."

"Dr. Shirakawa. And it seems the alignment of the Granzons dimensional coupler has been knocked off. Overexposure to other dimensional distorsions, I don't doubt. I'll need to shield it, shouldn't take more than a day..."

Kar-Wai shakes his head. "Maybe we should just take the Eurydice, and save the bother. All this warping is making my implants ache..."

"Yes...a few hours on a stable platform should be enough."

---

"General Doban?"

"Bet Barshem, I wasn't expecting a report so soon. You've only been gone a Gartol or two. What could have happened?"

"General, I've witnessed first-hand the situation on Earth. The anti-government factions are at each others throats, the moment the Federation attacked them they began infighting. Some even turned on their own side. They're a rabble, the Shadow Mirrors are merely the most professional and better-equipped of them. Where it not for the swift action their pilots, they may have been killed by their own side."

"I see... It seems we'll have to discount the lesser factions then. Stay with the Shadow Mirrors, I shall prepare an immediate delegation to the Federation. We'll find out once and for all who rules Earth, and whether we can trust them."

---

The door of the cabin bursts in, and Bullet leaps in front of Kusuha, chair-leg in hand. "Don't come any closer!! I won't le... You!!"

Vindel Mauser grins. "You recognise me, don't you boy? I'd expect no less from the agents of Helios Olympus. Now, you have to get out of here!" Lemon tosses a gun to the confused young man.

"Wh...You're just freeing us? Like that?"

"It seems my own agents have turned on us, securing my Zweizergain but neglecting to look for us. But, with the ELF transport broken open, you two should be able to get to your mech. Given the chaos thats raging out there, I think we'd be safer if you intervened."

Kusuha puts her hand on Bullets arm. "Bullet-kun, you can feel it too, can't you? Ryukooh is calling out."

"Yeah, its just like before... Koryuoh smells the Einst."

The two rush out, heading towards the transport Dumi had broken. Lemon watches as they run through the chaos. "Einst... German for 'First'. Somehow, I don't think thats a coincidence."

Vindel nods. "No. It seems Helios and his friends may hold the key to the mystery in Geneva. Now, I beleive you said the ELF had rather kindly repaired your Ashsaber?"

"There should be room to squeeze you in... But not too tightly, Axel might complain."

"I'll endeavour to stay in his good graces."

---

"This is Iron-3 to Black Knight. We are approaching rendevous, ETA 13 minutes. Report status of targets."

"Finally... Target groups Alpha and Gamma seem to be making a move. Both groups are sending forces to the west of the base. The Irregulars are moving as one, the Shadow Mirrors sending a small scout flotilla. Shall I pursue?"

"Hmmm..."

SRWQ SPECIAL MISSION: YUUKIQUEST

You are Yuuki Jegnan, combat commander of Team SRX and pilot of the R-1. You've been given by your commander, Director Yukiko Date, to gain maximum combat data on the Irregular and Shadow Mirror forces holed up in the DC's secret jungle base. Capturing units and pilots is a secondary objective. In addition, you are to send in a special forces team to retrieve agent Shine Hausen, with secondary objectives of sabotage, data and technology retrieval. Confirmation of the nature of the Irregulars and their technology is considered a high priority.

You're not meant to kill if its unnessecary, but secrecy is paramount. Certainly, if things escalate to a high enough level, and you're forced to use THAT, protocol states you have to kill everything...

---
```
Yuuki has at his command:

The R-1, piloted by himself.
The R-2, piloted by Tenzan Nakajima, an aloof, superior sort, fond of chess and other 'higher' forms of entertainment.
The R-3, piloted by Kobayashi-2, a bald woman with a haunted look on her face, and a potent but unstable source of TK energy.
The R-Gun, piloted by his lover, Carla Borgnine, a happy, carefree woman whose endless exuberance hides her School training (The entire team is ex-School), and her dedication to her job as 'Designated Burninator'.

In addition, you have a detachment of 8 R-0 mass-production models, with School-trained pilots. You can also call upon Black Knight and her partner Seolla, in the StealthWurger and StealthFalken respectively.

And finally you have Shocker Unit, 10 cybernetically-enhanced operatives, meant to infiltrate the base and perform any number of covert, or overt, missions.
```

```
The people Yuuki has to worry about:

Target Group Alpha: The Shadow Mirrors in the DC Base
2 Trilobite
2 Gespensts
1 Rathgrith
1 Angelg
1 Vysaga
1 Schutzwald
1 Soldifar
2 Irregulars units: A fast silver aerial type, and one with a human face
A white Grungust type
The Huckebien

Target Beta: The DC base itself
Heavy camoflaged defenses
At least 3 squadrons of Lions, 2 of Landlions, 1 of Barrelions
2 Rhinoceros land battleships, including one customised with alien technology
A group of 3 experimental AMs referred to as Star Team.

Target Gamma: The Irregulars
Large gespenst-based super robot.
2 DC-type Super Robots
15 MP mechs of the Huckebien type

Target Delta: The Shadow Mirror forces who are heading in the same direction as Target Gamma (and will meet them soon).
StealthRaubtier
Guarlion
```

Yuuki has the codes for Pattern OOC and HTB, but using them is an admission that things have gotten so out of hand, that things have to be ENDED. Protocol if the SRX has to be used is to kill all targets who see it with extreme prejudice. It's never come up that that wouldn't be what you're doing anyway.

WHAT WILL YUUKI DO WITH THE FORCES AT HIS COMMAND? Priority is keeping people alive and mechs intact. Capturing is only to be done if possible. If they just go in, fight a few rounds with the Irregulars, and get out with the combat data, thats a successful mission. Everything else is a bonus.
