# Episode 30

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 30: Goddammit guys, we don't even need trolls anymore!

In our last, relatively content-light thread (seriously, what have I spawned that causes so much discussion?), Katina and company arrived back on Earth, at a secret location in China where the Junkers Faction and the Earth' Liberation Front were meeting. Most of the team began paying their blood-money to the DC for destroying their space base, while Katina wandered off to help a construction worker called Rand to pull an ancient lion-shaped mechanoid out of the ground. Unfortunately, it turned out the thing was infested with Einst tentacles, so Katina bravely electrocuted it (and Rand) in the middle of the DC camp, then ran screaming at the next mechanoid. This caused a bit of confusion.

While the other factions finally realise that somethings up other than Katina, she is wrestling a giant snake-thing, which threatens to crush her in its coils. Meanwhile, Dumi, in his new ship form, heads for the Zweizergain, the cause of and solution to most of the Shadow Mirrors problems.

Adrenaline pumps into your system as you scream your fury at the Snake "FUCK YOU!! IF YOU WON't FRY, YOU'LL BUUUUURRRNN!!!" You swing the whole mech around several times and toss it into the air. The tail wrenchs out of the back of the Raioh, squirting some kind of liquid. The Raioh glows red and leaps into the air, its legs aflame.

"RISING METEOR!!!"

You kick the snake, hard. Chunks of purple armor and green psuedoflesh fly everywhere. Then you turn on a dime, and kick it again. And again. And again.

The flaming ruin crashes down into the side one of the bulk transports meant to transport the Bartols, leaving a massive dent. Its still trashing about however, and the green pesudopods are emerging from the wounds, waving about in some pattern you don't quite recognise.

Well this has gone well. You turn and see Dumi, suspending the Zweizergain from some kind of energy beam, and surrounded by ELF forces. A dozen Soldifars, a Vairose and a Simurgh Splendid are all aiming their weapons right at him.

WHAT WILL OUR HEROINE DO?

Yeah. He may not act much like it, but he's still a Major, and I'd wager he's still smart enough to know he has to really step up and take charge now. Either way, we're still far too violent and unreliable to be considered a valued member of the team like Irm or Bullet, Raioh or not.

Bringing Zwei back to him is probably our best option. For now, set it to warp to whatever safe location we can think of.

The hallmark of any effective harem is for its members to be grateful for the autonomy afforded them by its master. Do it right and nobody will even recognize there's a harem until you spring the booty call.

The Granzon's teleportation isn't stable when transporting dimensionally active materials like those in me and the Zweizergain. I'll have to use my own transportation abilities.

A hundred voices ring across the comm frequencies. "You're not going anywhere. You seek to destroy the future, the salvation of mankind through our union." The Bartols fill the air, pointing guns at everyone, even the ELF, even other DC units. "You will all stand down, and the ODE system will see the truth."

"You dumbass, Juergen!" You point over at the Snake, which is picking itself up, green tentacles once again forming purple armor. "THAT is the real threat!! It called the EFA, it's bringing the fucking Beowulves. And you're pointing guns at me?? ME??"

The hundred voices come again. "I am not Juergens, I am all within the ODE system. I act as one, but am many. And we have seen what you will do if left alone, far worse than one beast could possibly do."

As if in retort to that, the snake begins spraying acid into the air. You dodge away, a few drops sizzling against your armor, but several Bartols simply melt. The retribution is swift and fierce, and the Snake dissappears in a haze of missiles and beams.

More shaking, and the snail erupts from the ground, tentacles forming a cannons on its shell. Something like a bats wing comes from another hole. Lily Junkers screams down the comms. "Hamills mechanoids have gone crazy!!! Juergens, stop being an idiot and get those Bartols into the transports!!!"

You boost through the melee towards Dumi, dodging stray shots. "He's not going to listen! He...they've gone mad! Dumi. shut them down again! Or show me how to do it!"

Too late. They're here.

The thirteen Gespensts, each leading a dozen of what look like giant alien skeletons. The black one at the fore hefts its F2W cannon.

"Well well..." Says the voice of Albero Est. "I figured it'd be you guys, somehow."

"Oh no!!! You don't get to die gloriously on my watch!!!" You boost after Kai."

Katina!!

"Just go! Come back for me in a minute or two, I'll have a decent kill-count by then!"

You boost forward through the chaos, swatting Bartols out of the way as you go. They may have learned how to avoid direct attacks from you, but they're focused on the mechanoids and haven't learned to avoid being blindsided.

Then a much larger shape gets between you and the First and Only forces.

"You!!" shouts Rand. "What the hell do you think you're doing, zappin' me like that?!? If Mail'd been in here, she could have been killed!!"

The new half-mechanoid, half-construction mech brandishes a ridiculously massive wrench at you. It seems the pilot is none the worse for wear after his mech was eaten by one of them.

"DGG-04, we read you. What is your reentry vector?"

I've already landed, 50 klicks west-southwest. I need to talk with someone in command, urgently!

"Do you need pickup? Are you damaged?"

No, just get me Axel or Irm. And make sure they know that the Irregulars and the DC cannot know about this. What I have here could change everything.
Kar-Wai blinks in the harsh sunlight. "I thought you were taking us to the jungle, not the desert, Mr Shirakawa."

"Dr. Shirakawa. And it seems the alignment of the Granzons dimensional coupler has been knocked off. Overexposure to other dimensional distorsions, I don't doubt. I'll need to shield it, shouldn't take more than a day..."

"Bet Barshem, I wasn't expecting a report so soon. You've only been gone a Gartol or two. What could have happened?"

"General, I've witnessed first-hand the situation on Earth. The anti-government factions are at each others throats, the moment the Federation attacked them they began infighting. Some even turned on their own side. They're a rabble, the Shadow Mirrors are merely the most professional and better-equipped of them. Where it not for the swift action their pilots, they may have been killed by their own side."

"Wh...You're just freeing us? Like that?"

Kusuha puts her hand on Bullets arm. "Bullet-kun, you can feel it too, can't you? Ryukooh is calling out."

The two rush out, heading towards the transport Dumi had broken. Lemon watches as they run through the chaos. "Einst...German for 'First'. Somehow, I don't think thats a coincidence."

Vindel nods. "No. It seems Helios and his friends may hold the key to the mystery in Geneva. Now, I beleive you said the ELF had rather kindly repaired your Ashsaber?"

"There should be room to squeeze you in...But not too tightly, Axel might complain."

"I'll endeavour to stay in his good graces."

SRWQ SPECIAL MISSION: YUUKIQUEST

You are Yuuki Jegnan, combat commander of Team SRX and pilot of the R-1. You've been given by your commander, Director Yukiko Date, to gain maximum combat data on the Irregular and Shadow Mirror forces holed up in the DC's secret jungle base. Capturing units and pilots is a secondary objective. In addition, you are to send in a special forces team to retrieve agent Shine Hausen, with secondary objectives of sabotage, data and technology retrieval. Confirmation of the nature of the Irregulars and their technology is considered a high priority.

You're not meant to kill if its unnessecary, but secrecy is paramount. Certainly, if things escalate to a high enough level, and you're forced to use THAT, protocol states you have to kill everything...

The R-1, piloted by himself.
The R-2, piloted by Tenzan Nakajima, an aloof, superior sort, fond of chess and other 'higher' forms of entertainment.
The R-3, piloted by Kobayashi-2, a bald woman with a haunted look on her face, and a potent but unstable source of TK energy.
The R-Gun, piloted by his lover, Carla Borgnine, a happy, carefree woman whose endless exuberance hides her School training (The entire team is ex-School), and her dedication to her job as 'Designated Burninator'.

In addition, you have a detachment of 8 R-0 mass-production models, with School-trained pilots. You can also call upon Black Knight and her partner Seolla, in the StealthWurger and StealthFalken respectively.

And finally you have Shocker Unit, 10 cybernetically-enhanced operatives, meant to infiltrate the base and perform any number of covert, or overt, missions.

Yuuki has the codes for Pattern OOC and HTB, but using them is an admission that things have gotten so out of hand, that things have to be ENDED. Protocol if the SRX has to be used is to kill all targets who see it with extreme prejudice. It's never come up that that wouldn't be what you're doing anyway.

WHAT WILL YUUKI DO WITH THE FORCES AT HIS COMMAND? Priority is keeping people alive and mechs intact. Capturing is only to be done if possible. If they just go in, fight a few rounds with the Irregulars, and get out with the combat data, thats a successful mission. Everything else is a bonus.

(And seriously guys, play along here. This is meant to be a fun diversion, where you get to decide how things escalate, and how Project SRX are drawn into the whole thing. I'm not going to take any I KILL MYSELF LOL shit, I want this done with the same almost-seriousness the main plot gets.)

Have Yuuki infiltrate the base, confirming troop makeup and integrity, Shine's location, etc. After mapping the area (or in case an extraction is necessary), move in Shocker Unit.

Everyone else can wait outside to engage Targets Gamma and Delta (including drawing aggro from Alpha). Keep the Black Knight and "White Godiva" on speed dial, but don't be hasty to call in favors.

At the very least, we must fuck this up in the most hilarious way possible.

Then have Yuuki suddenly become hypercompetent and just barely get out alive with everyone.

VOTES FOR FAILURE ARE NOT BEING PERMITTED. Votes are only allowed for actual strategies. Flawed strategies are ok as long as they're not obviously destined to fail.

This is a vote for a plan, not for what actually happens in the plot. That comes later.

Try to get some form of consensus before we hit autosage, please?

Nah, Barely escape and then try again the very next day, Fail and barely escape, Rinse and repeat several times until Yukiko sends a douchebag replacement that none in the team can stand and they all defect because some extremely silly reason.

Send the grunts on an obviously suicidal attack as a diversion.
Hide the R-Series mechs somewhere and infiltrate the Trilobite.
Find that Shine's already escaped. Bloody useless guards

I think this was a terrible idea, Sciencegar. I mean, come on.

We're the guys who make Katina try and rape everything. What do you think is going to happen if we're suddenly given control of a group of people our beloved psycho is opposed to, and we have never seen before?

Of course we'll stuff it up.

In any case, I'd say we use everyone as a distraction to get the Stealths filled with Shockers into and out of the base.

Fine, test Targets Alpha & Beta's defenses. See what they're capable of, then retreat. If it looks like we can wipe them out without resorting to the SRX, attempt to do so. If not, attempt stealth entry and Shine rescue.

See it from this side, Hyper Incompetent MashymereYuuki, Do you really think he would try killing them? Even with his orders? I see this as comic relief.

No, guys, you're doing it wrong. We need to take actions which would seem reasonable to Yuuki, but that we know can only possibly end in failure, mainly due to not knowing what the opposition is capable of.

How is this for a plan?

R-1 Goes after Team Delta since it can transform it can out preform and intercept them, And Yuuki would be slowed down by any back up... According to himself.

Stealth Team goes after Alpha Team, Led By R-3 and a 4 R-0es, Since the Tem leaders are all flyers they can emply Hit and run tactics while the R-0es give AA support.

The rest attacks Beta team, Using Heavy bombardment from a range, with the R-oes giving support to the R-2 and R-Gun in Metal Genocider mode.

Also, Obsess about honour.

Sounds good. Be overconfident, after all, SRX solo'd Bian, clearly these guys will be NO threat at all in comparison.

Anyway, the SRX is perphaps one of the most powerfull mechs there is in the entire OG-verse, so plan:

Deploy the Shock troopers and wait until they can get close to the base without alerting anyone.

When they do, combine and shoot the HTB cannon two times:

One at the Shadow Mirrors. Destroy the trillobites and every single person inside it.

The second at the DC base. Same thing, kill everyone inside those ships.

Then have team A of the troopers infiltrate the Irregulars and steal the DGGs mid-confusion, and have them kill as many people there as possible.

Have team B try to capture the few SM mechs that remain.

Team C infiltrates the DC base in ruins to recover Shine.

Then separate the team completely whith each guy going into different directions so we are harder to track down. Reunite at a preestablished location.

This should take no more than 10 minutes.

Shine is in one of the Trilobites. These two objectives are mutually incompatible. Also, destroying the trilobites makes it difficult at best to recover anything useful from the wreckage: The HTB cannon doesn't leave much behind.

>Also, how strong are Tronium explosions?

Too strong. Also, if you lose any tronium, Yuuki might as well slit his own throat now rather than go back to base (Only 6 pieces in existence, remember? Maybe even less in this universe.)
