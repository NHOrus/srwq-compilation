# Episode 03

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

####SRWQ Mission 3: It's not /tg/, it's /u/

You are the Shadow Mirror version of Katina Tarask. You wear frilly dresses and don't afraid of anything.

You and the other Shadow Mirrors were about to escape destruction by the EFA by travelling to another dimension, when an army of mechs from that dimension arrived to...do something. It wasn't entirely clear what was happening, but then things started exploding. You and your allies climbed into a Tausendfuessler and escaped the Tesla-Liecht Institute, but you were followed.

Then the ghost of your best friend Arado, who you strangled with a power lead in a fit of psychotic rage 2 months ago, came back from hell to claim your soul for your many sins.

Or at least that's how you see it.

Your allies:

Irmgard Kazahara: Womaning super robot pilot and son of one of Shadow Mirrors main scientists. Hasn't realised he's not in charge, you are. Piloting a modified Gust Lander.

Latooni Subota: Cold, dispassionate strategist and sniper. Graduate of the School, who kicked you out for being too crazy. Thinks this makes her better than you. You intent to teach her who's boss later. In bed. Piloting a Randgrith.

Russel Bagman: A nice Irish man who recruited you into the Shadow Mirror. Smart enough to know to follow your orders. In a Gespenst.

I. Douglas: Some redheaded chick who likes guns, who Russel saved from the EFA. You haven't actually asked her name yet, just read her nametag: You've been too worked up about Subota to notice her. In a red Gespenst that seems to have sentimental value to her.

Johnathan Kazahara: Scientist dude. Too old for your tastes. Flying the Tausendfuessler.

The Transport: Apparently full of more minions and mechs. Landed just a short distance from your Tausendfeussler.

Your Enemies:

The Transforming thing with the overly dramatic guy in it: Fighting your Gespensts.

The flying one with the sniper rifle: In a sniper duel with Latooni and Irm.

The Devil Ghost of Arado: A part of your mind registers that this is probably just the version of Arado from the other dimension, but you stopped listening to that part of your brain when Aguila took away Mr Flopsy after you joined The School.

SUDDENLY ACTUAL PLOT

"Ack!! Get off me!!! Stop, Katina!"

"IT WASN'T MY FAULT!! YOU BROKE OUR PROMISE!! THAT SLUT DIDN'T DESERVE YOU!!! IT JUST HAPPENED!!"

You are holding desperately onto the leg of the Wild Wuerger, raining blow after blow on it, as Arado desperately manuvers to try to throw you off. Your R-Blades tonfa is now tearing chunks of the Jacket Armor off, exposing the more vunerable mech inside.

"D-dammit, Katina, you're forcing me to do something I don't want to..."

"LIKE YOU FORCED YOURSELF ON THAT BIG-TITTED SLUT???"

"Wha....TO HELL WITH YOU!!"

The Stag Beetle Crusher snags your blade arm, gets a firm grip, and then rips the arm right out of its socket and tosses it away."

"THERE! Now will you let go of me and stop saying things that don't make sense?"

"Arado-kuuuun, why do you always hurt me-he-he-heeee??"

"DAMMIT I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU!!"

Arado points the Wuergers left arm at you. It has a rather nice sword holstered in it, but more to the point, its has 3 heavy-caliber machine cannons that at pointed at the R-blades head.

WHAT DO YOU DO?

"I'm only going to count to three..."

"BAAAAAAWHAWHAWHAAAAW!! I just wanted a friend! The School was so hard, I wanted someone to talk to! Someone to share the heartache! Please....I don't to be alone..."

"....ngh....Dammit..."

The arm cannons are lowered, and the Wuerger starts to lose altitude.

"I'm going to drop you off on the ground, and then you're going to get your friends to stop this pointless fight, alright."

"This fight isn't over UNTIL I SAY IT'S OVER!!!"

The Head Vulcans rattle into the Wuerger's face, cracking one camera. Your left tonfa discarded to grab the leg, you reach out and pull on the Wuergers Cold Metal Sword. However, your yank on the hilt, even at full boost, fails to pull the blade out: It's locked into the arm assembly.

Arado's scream of formless fury is almost as loud as yours. The cannon shells disintegrate your left hand and most of the forearm, and suddenly, with no grip, you're falling.

IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR YOU'D LIKE TO DO BEFORE YOU HIT THE GROUND??

"FUCKSHITCUNTASSMOTHERFUCKINGPURPLEHAIREDDICKPUSSY!!!" You scream as you fall, firing off your vulcans wildly. Arado flies the Wuerger out of you fire arc.

"What in the heck?!?! The real Katina was never this crazy. At least, not as often..."

"Russel!! Catch me you fat irish fuck!!!"

BZHZHZZHZHHZ

"...Russel?"

You boost out of the fall and land roughly but intact near the Trilobite. You look up and see Russel's blue Gespenst lying immobile, missing both its arms. Beyond them, Ibis is desperately boosting away from the Transforming Mech, which is taking potshots at her with a revolver.

"Ah! No! I can't let you damage this mech! It's Sleighs!"

"Please, Mirror-Ibis, you have to calm dow-"

"Stop calling me that!!"

You shrug and head toward the Trilobite.

"That flying style...I know you."

"That voice!"

"You're Bronzo 27, aren't you?"

"L-Latooni??"

Latooni had already anticipated the second of confusion. An armor-piercing shell rips through the Wildfalkens upper torso, disabling the right arm and smashing the Tesla Drive. Seolla's mech dropped like a rock.

"Damn you!!!"

The Cold Metal Sword slices through Latooni's Linear Cannon, and the Wuerger's leg strikes the side of her units cockpit-head. Latooni grits her teeth and fights the urge to vomit from the rocking.

"Bronzo 28...Arado Balanga."

"No! To hell with this! I don't care if you are Latooni, you Shadow Mirrors are all crazy!! We came here to end your stupid organisation, and we will! And if some of you madmen die on the way, I won't shed any tears!!!"

Feint with the Scissor Knife. Pointblank Matrix missiles.

Block with the Crusher. Duck under the missiles and slash at legs. Hydraulics reduced to 50% pressure.

Much better than our Arado, thinks Latooni.

Spider Net from torso launcher. Shoulder charge, gain distance, more missiles.

Trapped in net. Counter charges. Cold Metal Sword severs right arm. Crusher grabs torso, maintaining pointblank range.

Too good, she realises.

The Stag Beetle Crusher closes its vicelike grip, metal shears. Struggling to prevent Arado beheading her with his sword, Latooni realised that even the durable Randgrith is in danger of simply being snapped in half under the pressure.

A lucky shot bursts the fuel lines on Ibis' left leg, tripping her Gespenst up. Irm stands conflicted, unable to decide which girl to try to save.

"Irm!! Save Ibis, I'll see about the cailin in the glasses!" Slash rippers emerge from the back of Russel's Gespenst and fly at Arado. The last of the Wuerger's jacket armor is ripped away as the blades worry at him like rabid dogs. Free from his indecision, Irm fires off a waves at the R-1, then charges at it, Drill screaming as it revs to full power.

Arado releases the stricken Randgrith and starts to fight the buzzing Slash Rippers. Latooni's mech slowly sinks to the ground, the shattered chassis unable to hold up its own wieght anymore.

"Change, R-Wiiiing!!!" Ryusei transforms and flies away from the swarm of missiles. Meant for destroying fortresses and battleship, the R-wing easily outraces them, turns around and blasts them with its own missiles.

The Slash Rippers suddenly pop like clay pigeons. Russel turns around to see the Wildfalken steadying itself on a boulder, sighting its rifle right at him.

"Stand down, you....you goddamn meatheads!!!"

"Seolla..."

"I can swear if I want!"

"STAND BACK MORTALS, MAKE WAY FOR THE GODDESS OF VICTORY!!!"

Arado sighs. "Not her again..."

The Raioh strides out of the Trilobite, wrapping a red cloth around its neck as it goes.

"Why are you doing that?" calls Rio from the Trilobite's cockpit. "That's just the tarpaulin we were covering it with."

"DON'T....question me?"

Ryusei is temporarily stunned. "A Kamen Rider mech?? That is so damned cool!! If a bit old-school."

"Right then, who shall be the first to be sacrificed on my altar of pain??"

No-one responds immediately, then a mechanical voice interjects.

While the Raioh is a high-end Super Robot, the capabilities of these new units are not to be underestimated. Perhaps you could acquiese to a little support?

Pic related strides out of the Trilobite, and joins you.

"What are you meant to be? Some kind of computer?"

I am the Dynamic Unlimited Military Intelligence, Operation AI of DDG-XAM-04. You may call me Dumi-chan.

"Doomy???....I like it. Now lets go kick some ass"

INTERLUDE: ELSEWHERE

Axel approaches the northern camp, and finds a few scattered Gespensts hiding behind a ridge.

"Captain Axel!! Thank god you're here! We're completely lost! What's going on."

"Commitees still out. What are you hiding from? EFA?"

"Er...no...it's a little more complicated than that..."

Axel leaps up to the top of the ridge, and has a good look at the scene.

"Well now....that is complicated, now that you mention it."

I've been considering the look for our new RaiOh supporter, and a few things have come to mind:

First, overall look in bike mode. I'm fond of the general look of Fenrir - lolAdventChildren aside, it's a pretty slick design. In particular, I'm imagining Katina pulling out a super robot-sized shotgun from one of those front compartments and going to town.

As for robot mode...the legs are concealed under the chassis in cycle mode, forming the underside. When it shifts to robot mode, they both slide down as if the mech was doing a reverse split, both legs rotate 90 degrees to face the same direction, and the wheels form the rear part of each leg and foot, allowing it to skate using them. The rear section of the bike forms the skirt armor and part of the torso, while the front section forms most of the upper body. Each section on either side of the front wheel becomes one of the forearms, with the compartments where RaiOh can draw guns from becoming large embedded tonfa. Other armaments include a chest cannon and hip-carried guns, which it can also use in motorcycle mode.

I don't have sufficient drawfag skills for this, but I might be able to provide a model of how the transformation should look.

I know the feeling, I'm having to miss out on Zeonquest to do this. But I haven't been feeling the epic of the Midway arc like everyone else seems to be, so it hasn't been too bad.

>>4425641

When you decribe the transformation like that, you remind me of Prowl from Transformers Animated...and now I'm trying to transform my figure and I can't get the legs to work.

I'm not too pushed about the exact design of the DGG-04, I'm happy simply to go with the idea of Giant Motorbike That Walks Like A Man. I should probably sort out the armament though, I'm thinking more Rider references, various non-kick equipment.

How about we make the wheels become this mech's signature weapons?

They would work just like the Aussen's shoulder plates, but these ones will be connected by some kind chains and this DGG will use them like giant kunais with chains (or flails).

I considered that - I also considered having each wheel split in two, so that the back section of the bike became the legs and the front section the upper body. In this configuration, the wheels would be connected to the back of each hand and be used like Slash Rippers. I dropped the idea because I liked the idea of tonfa fightan more, and the forearms would be overcrowded with melee weapons if it was done that way. Plus, it wouldn't make the transformation look as good.

Can't we get a little flexible on the way the mech transforms just for the sake of making it look cooler while at the same time adding some cool new weapons? This is a Super robot from a line that sees it practical to make a giant robot transform into a horse for another giant robot with a gigantic blade to ride on.

I think we could just follow the rule of cool and place the wheels wherever they look the coolest even if it doesn't make sense in context and call it a day.

Also, why not have both the tonfas and the flails? Maybe the mech could carry the machine guns in it's shoulders, carry the tonfas in it's waist and the wheels on it's back.

While I think you're 90% of the way there, I'd like to step in and exercise some minor creative control

>General Gunner: (Shoulder mounted guns).

Rename them to Lanzekanones, and move them to the chest. Give them a Lanzekanone CombiShot mode, where you click them together to form a shotgun, usable by the 04 or the Raioh.

>General Blaster: (Chest beam).

Why go chest beam? Follow your source material: The Daizengar's blasters are on the shoulder, where we said we'd put the wheels. Put them in a similar position to DGGs shoulderpads and you're done. The wheels are already a weapons system, let them do double duty.

>Stahl-Tonfa:

I'm not really the biggest fan of gratuitous german...

Memory Cell Tactical Weapons System Ridol

An adaptable melee and ranged weapons system designed to supplement Unit 4 and the Raioh combat ability, the 4 Ridols stored in the forearms can assume multiple forms thanks to Memory Cell technology. Current available forms are Ridol Tonfa, Ridol Slasher, Ridol Whip and Ridol Javelin. The hilts of the Ridols also contain the Ridol Shooter beam cannons, and a Ridol Pistol form is available.

>Zerstörung Reifen( Flails)

What the hell does that even mean? The best google is giving me is 'age of destruction' or something.

But yes, the Ridol Whips attach to the wheels, which charge up like the Schulteplatte, and bash the enemy.

His weakness lies in the fact that he won't be dealing much damage either. His big size will make it difficult to hit opponents and the damage dealt does not make up for that.

This is where Katina and her mech comes into play. She is the one who will deal massive, and I mean MASSIVE damage. Her recklessnes leaves her open for attacks, but Dumi will use his mobility to quickly reach Katina before the opponent and use his defense to block incoming attacks.

So, at the end of OG2 we kill the fuck out of the einst right? In Endless Frontier we fight on top of Einst Regiseur and kill off the remaining life force of the einst. This seems to be the same dimension as the end of OG2. Do you guys think this was a coincidence and there are other einst dimensions out there? or do you think all the einst come from one dimension and by defeating them there all einst everywhere were defeated?

Assuming option 2 is true, does that mean OG2 and Endless Frontier saved SMverse?

There might be other Einst dimensions. Though even if there is only one, SM verse is still fucked since Einst Beowulf is still around.

Dumi was made to look out for threats to the Shadow Mirror's, and will measure the level of danger they possess and react accordingly. The activation of the portal and the appearance of the OG-verse in this universe activated Dumi and then it saw fit to take the strongest of the DGG units to safety. This is where you meet him.

Much later, after a fight against Sanger/the SRX/the Weiss and the Alt, Dumi realizes the great power these invaders have, and sees the need to power up the RaiOh and upgrade it into the DaiRaiOh, but the enemies catch on this plan. Someone tries to attack the inmobile RaiOh's with an incredibly powerful attack. Dumi tries to deflect it and takes the attack instead. This severily damages the AI's main computer, leaving Dumi almost dead. Also, while the total destruction of the RaiOh was averted, it can no longer upgrade into the Dai. Dumi then takes his final moments to reconfigure his body to make it manned and to unlock a secret battle formation that was reserved for emergencies.

Then he chooses a pilot to ride him. "Insert Pilot here" is selected, and then he/she uses the newly unlocked "Insert attack's name here" formation where the RaiOh rides the DGG-4 and the rest is history.

You do realize this thread isn't cannon right? After OG2 and OGS, maybe OGG, no information on SMverse is ever given. I've never heard anyone say Beowulf is still around being a terror. I've never heard anyone say Beowulf died either. Unless it's stated in an upcoming game or OGG, then we have no idea what's happening in SMverse.

I think OGG retcons all Einst are dead, seeing Alfimi is alive, well technically.

I think they are like the Borg, there can be more than one "Queen" Einst so to speak

According to TV Tropes, the OG Einst are apparently originally from earth, created by some ancient civilisation that also formed the Balmar Empire, which I assume means they're related to the Ganeden, like their enemies the Chokijin are. The acid test would be whether something similar is true for the Einst in Impact, and how badly those ones were beaten.

Frankly, the OG version of the Ganeden/Chokijin/Einst storyline is giving me a real Eva vibe. Ganeden Third Impact in OG3, anyone?

Basing this on what I've heard.

I heard Alfimi formed some sort of bond with Axel so they could both avoid death.

Wish I understood moon so I could speak in definite.

Of course it isn't canon though it would be amusing if it was. I don't have the translation of the drama cd anymore since I wiped my drive but Axel wound up leaving Einst Beowulf behind after he detonated the teleporter. Beowulf raged when he realized he couldn't leave so theres a good chance he's still around in SM land.

Of course thats speculation on my part, he may have died in the explosion/was unable to regenerate.

If only we could just find out what happened in SMverse after OGS then we would at least confirm

(If Einst are all dead in SMverse)
That is was the same Einst dimension invading both

(If Einst still function)
There are multiple Einst dimensions.

The obvious choice would be Ruach from Alpha 3, the little brat who's puppet ruler of the Balmar and controls the Geber Gan Eden.

I wouldn't trust TV Tropes on anything. SRW is pretty easy to make up false information for.

If they were created by Augustus...it's possible, but the Chokijin are technically supposed to serve Irui. RyuOhKi just thought she went nuts and broke ranks, which led to the Alpha 2 Kusuha plotline. Then again, Shin RyuOhKi and Son Ganlon apparently exist independently of the Ganeden stuff. Ganlon mentions he was only serving Irui because his "clan" got basically drafted into the war against the Yokujin (or whatever they are, can't remember). As soon as someone more powerful and more inline with his way of thinking showed up he bailed. The Einst, on the other hand, definitely don't like her. Alfimi makes a few references to "The Guardian" that makes it sound like the Einst and Irui tangled in the past.

Man, I can't keep this stuff straight. Have a big Irui.

I dunno, it looks like he actually has a spine from what I have seen in videos. Shinji has no spine.

Yeah, Ruach is basically asshole shota with a God complex. If he got command of Third Impact he'd just use it to create a world where he's even more the centre of everything.

Not nearly as much of a momma's boy, since he's basically of divine heritage, for all intents and purposes.

Of course, this is assuming he gets that far before Shiva knocks him down to size, beats his ass down like a redheaded stepchild, and steals his Gan Eden again.
