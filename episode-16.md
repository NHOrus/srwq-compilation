# Episode 16

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 16: Cradle of Fuckin' Civilisation

We continue to follow the adventures of the Shadow Mirrors, in particular Katina Tarask, as their world is turned upside down by the arrival of the OG Heroes, seeking to stop the plans of Dark Brain. On the run from the EFA, the rag-tag fleet of former terrorists heads to Africa, where Colonel Van Vat Tran has made his last stand, after the defeat of his allies, the Inspectors.

We take a short break from Katina while Lenonjayce Starlord kicks her ass at Counterstrike, and focus on two of our other heroines: Latooni Subota, cold calculating School Graduate, and Ibis Douglas, team artillery expert, pining for her lost friend Sleigh.

What awaits our heroes in Africa? Who is chasing them? And what threats lie within their own ranks? Only time will tell...

Current complement:

Trilobite 1 carrying: Raioh, DGG-04 Dumi, WildRaubtier, Greenpenst (under construction), Redpenst, Blupenst, Rathgrith

Trilobite 2 carrying: Angelg (Almost repaired), Vysaga, Soulgain (still smashed up), Schutzwald, Soldifar.

Tausendfuessler carrying Ganzon and one other mech.

Trilobite 2 is not in as good a shape as the one Ibis is used to. It entered the Lygeus portal and was rudely thrown out by a wave of unprobability, then sent on a desperate run across the US, dodging EFA patrols, before being worked over by the R-series in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. It's been repaired as best it can, but its obvious one night of patching the holes and refitting the engines hasn't brought it back to full capacity.

But its not really Ibis or Latooni's job to fix this, they're here to pilot mechs. The Schutzwald and the Soldifar are fully loaded, in case there should be any surprises in the Atlantic, but it occurs to Ibis that she hasn't really gotten to know this mech, and to Latooni that she hasn't even truly piloted the Assault Dragoon.

On the other hand, two veteran Shadow Mirrors, Loveless and Luckfield, are in the hangar, checking on their mechs. And, to be honest, the two former squadmates of Barrison Platoon haven't had much chance to discuss what's happened over the past few days.

---

"Well, it would seem we have a bevy of fine damsels I was not aware of..."

Brooklyn bows courteously as the two girls approach.

"A pleasure to meet you. I am 2nd Lt Brooklyn Luckfield, and by the grace of providence I am the pilot of the Vysaga. And whom might you be."

"Er, Ibis Douglas, Master Sergeant. I-I guess its nice to meet you."

"...Just call me Subota." Latooni looks up at the Vysaga. "A new Vairose class?"

"Indeed! It was originally to be given to Unit W, but the failure of the portal meant I had to secure it from the enemy. Thankfully I was able to meet up with Major Axel, and, er, Lamia, and escort the ship to meet you. Hmm, I just realised, I never asked Ms Loveless her real rank..."

"Er, do you guys happen to have a simulator on this ship? It's just, we only just got our mechs, and we're not 100% on what they can do..."

"I'm afraid I have to dissappoint you, Ms Douglas. Trilobites are combat vessels, not training ships. One of the compromises it has to make for all the stealth and speed is that it's not a flying base like the Space Noah class. Facilities like training simulators have to be left back at base."

"...which we no longer have."

"Indeed. I'm afraid that if you want to practise, your only option is to open the topside hatch and have a sparring session on the roof of the ship."

"Sparring? As in, with melee weapons?"

"Well, we wouldn't want any stray shots to hit the other ships..."

---

Dressed in her silver jacket, undershirt threatening to pull out of her pants with all the body it has to cover, Lamia Loveless paints a striking portrait. She walks over the hull of the Angelg as the last of its repairs are being completed.

"Ahoy, Miss Loveless! How go things!" Brooklyn shouts up to her.

She turns and climbs down to the small group. "Mr Luckfi...no, Brooklyn. I'm feeling fine, thank you very much. And... I haven't been introduced to you two yet."

"I'm Ibis, and this is Latooni. We're glad to meet y-"

"Aren't you one of the W-series?"

Latooni's question kills the conversation stone dead. Lamias face twists with a mixture of awkwardness and shame.

"I... I was reconstructing by Miss Browning's methods, yes. But that... that doesn't mean... I'm not a person."

"It should. Half your brain should be microchips."

"Latooni!"

"I'm merely pointing out another irregularity in this crew. So far, our roster of pilots consists primarily of maniacs and alcoholics. It doesn't make for a very cohesive fighting unit."

Lamia frowns at the teen. "I... I'm going to fight for this world, with all of you as my allies! I don't care whether you accept me or not, I'll fight anyway!"

"So long as the damage to your personality doesn't degenerate further, making you useless."

This is getting awkward, thinks Ibis.

Ibis tries to surreptiously kick Latooni, and mainly ends up stepping on her foot instead. Latooni barely seems to twitch.

"Lat, that kind of talk is poisonous to the team! If you want to have a cohesive group, that kind of commentary is the worst thing you can do!"

"I fail to see how I can make things worse. We're being led by a small-minded man who's pitifully close-minded sense of right and wrong leads him to crippling inaction. His leadership is being undermined by a dangerous free agent and a robot with no-one to program her. Our most powerful mechs are being piloted by a perverted maniac, a computer system too sophisticated to be made with existing technology, and a mad scientist with delusions of grandeur. The most reliable members of our team are a Irishman and a South Carolina ex-valley girl with a gun fetish."

Ibis kicks her again, harder.

"You... If you're so convinced we're useless, why don't you do something about it? Huh?"

Latooni adjusts her glasses, and starts walking back towards the Soldifar. "I don't want to. I like a challenging work environment."

Lamia turns away, a sad expression on her face. Ibis goes over to her, and puts a reassuring hand on her shoulder.

"Don't worry about what Latooni said. You're a member of this team, and I for one will stick beside you."

"And I!", Brooklyn proclaims. "A gentleman never abandons a lady."

Lamia manages a weak smile. "Thank you. I wasn't sure how I'd be treated if everyone knew I was... one of the Series."

"Well, don't worry about it. It won't come up, at least not compared to Katinas antics."

Brooklyn looks at Lamia thoughtfully. "Ms Loveless, if I may be so bold...Why are you wearing Major Almer's uniform?"

Lamia visibly blushes. "Er... well... when I came too, after the fight... I just didn't want to put on that terrible green dress anymore. It just looked so... artificial... Like something a doll would wear. I wanted to wear something... a real person would wear."

"I...  see. But, isn't the Major going to want his clothes back eventually?"

"I... er... didn't think of that."

"Well, don't worry about it, Lamia. You're part of out team now, and we'll see this through till the end. Together."

Ibis had expected a smile, or a friendly nod. She hadn't expected Lamia to glomp her.

"Oh... thank you, Ibis. I..*sniff*... You don't know how much this means to me.."

Ibis says nothing, because any attempt to speak would result in a mouthful of boob. Oh god...they're massive! How does she stand up straight with these things? Is her spine artificial too?

The tender moment is rudely cut short by the combat alert going off.

"All pilots to your stations! We have detected DC forces engaged in battle with an EFA fleet! Be prepared to engage. Repeat, all pilots to stations!"

####BACK TO KATINA

*Katina, I'll pull alongside the Tausendfuessler and let you transfer to the Raioh, alright?*

"Awesome! Dangerous middle-of-the-air acrobatics straight out of a movie!!"

*You could just climb down a ladder into the cockpit you know.*

"..."

*I feel the need to point these things out.*

The Granzon floats out the back of the Tausendfuessler and turns upright as the DGG-04, the Raioh perched atop of it, hovers alongside. With a Tarzan yell, you leap out of the Fuessler on a rope, and swing gracefully into the Raioh open cockpit. You fail to notice the microadjustments Dumi makes to ensure you don't bash yourself off the Raioh chest and fall into the sea.

Turning on your targeting computer, you identify 3 Rhino-class land battleships, engaged in fierce conflict with 5 Kestrel-class EFA cruisers. The air is thick with energy beams, shells, and dueling mechs. It looks like quite the epic battle.

"Going for the big ones! Clear me a path guys!!"

Varying levels of confirmation come from the others. The long-range mechs start to fire on the EFA Gespensts, several spiralling down into the mangrove swamps below. In response, the nearest battleship and its escorts start to turn in the direction of the Shadow Mirror formation.

*Interesting...*

"What is it Dumi?"

A window pops up in front of Katina and zooms into the central Rhino. It's definitely not a normal version: It's painted in what looks like golden beam coating, the prow blade is charged with energy, and behind the main artillery guns is a new turret which fires some kind of energy beams, which are ripping into one of the certral Kestrels.

*This battleship doesn't look like it uses standard DC technology. It would seem the rumours of Vat Trans alien technology are true.*

As Dumi says this, he's partaking in emergency evasive manuvers to avoid fire from the battleship, which has quite rightly marked you out as the biggest thread. The Raioh is almost thrown off the DGG-04. 5 Gespensts move in to intercept the two of you.

"You think you gnats can test me?! DOUBLE PLASMA LEADER!!!" Lightning leaps from the Raiohs hands and snags two of the oncoming mechs. You swing one in a big arc, while the other intercepts a brace of missiles and a battleship beam that were headed for you.

"I'll call it... COUNTER TOSS!!" The other Gespenst flies through the air and impacts on the Kestrel's hull, and kindly explodes, knocking out one of the turrets.

*Katina, engage flight mode!* Dumi transforms from under you and deploys his barrier, as a massive anti-ship missile explodes against it. You grab two more mechs and fling them, but the battleship hits them in its haste to shoot you down, and they are destroyed well short of thier target.

The final Gespenst is charging you, firing its M95 in one hand and charging the plasma stakes on the other.

The Gespensts shells burst against the Raiohs armor to little effect, and the plasma stakes fail to penetrate, merely buckling the plate. You're too invested in your next move to care much about his, but a hit from the Schutzwald knocks the Gespenst out of the fight.

"Dumi, this time you're the projectile!"

*Very well.*

You grab Dumi as he converts to Motorad mode and swing him at the Kestrel, his barrier deflecting beams as he goes. The wheels of the Motorad sprout blades and charge with energy, as the mech slams into the hull of the cruiser, then screechs along it, chunks of hull flying everywhere as the wheels churn in the metal as if it were mud. Dumi screechs to a halt at the end of the ship, does a wheelie, and drives back down the opposite side of the hull, before leaping off and transforming to rejoin you.

The Kestrel is listing from the loss of most of its topside systems, and is no longer firing beams. Instead it fires out a wall of flak as it turns, trying desperately to disengage.

Ignoring the flak, you boost into the air and lock the Raioh legs into position. "No-one fucks with me lives! LIGHTNING FALL!!!"

The flaming comet of the Raioh ploughs straight through the stricken Kestrel, which survives 3 seconds with a red-hot hole drilled through it before exploding in a mighty blast, raining shrapnel across the battlefield. You land in the mangrove swamps, the remnants of the plasma burning away a sizable chunk of protected swampland.

Irm, Russel and Echidna come up to you, still firing at airborne Gespensts. "Well... good work, Katina. I suppose you are useful after all."

Beyond, the battle is going evenly, with Vat Tran's ship sinking another Kestrel, while the remaining EFA concentrate on another Rhino, which looks to be stricken.

"Dumi, save that Rhino!" You boost up into the sky, trying not to overheat your mech like you did in Mexico. Your Harken Impulse flies out, tagging one Gespenst and scattering several more. One is sniped down by Echidna.

Dumi does as he does best, flying right in front of an enemy ship and blocking each of the beam shots. You find yourself impressed by Dumi once more, his defensive capabilities are incredible, as he's still unscratched. He peppers the battleship with Lanzekannone and Ridol Beam fire as he goes, focusing on sensors and turrets.

The Rhino manages to disengage and roll backwards, leaving the fight trailing smoke. Without a target, the EFA ships turn to more relevant threats, such as Vat Trans ship, and you.

The beam hits you in the back as you mash two Gespensts together into one. It burns through one of your shoulders, and something inside pops. The right arm displays are turning orange.

"I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU!!!" You boost hard, heading straight at the offending Kestrel. It responds with a brace of anti-ship missiles, but the plasma leaders scoop them up and throw them away. Then the tendrils grab onto the Kestrel itself.

"YOU THINK YOU'RE SO TOUGH WITH YOUR OVERSIZED DINGHY. KISS MY FEET."

The ship is too massive to be moved by the Raioh, so the Leaders drag the Raioh into the Kestrel. The bridge and a good chunk of the ships bows turn waxy from the heat, as the Raioh is buried in the ship up to its waist.

"Hah! And you can kiss my cute metal butt too while you're at it!"

Then it dawns on you that you're sort of stuck. On a sinking battleship. That, with the myriad secondary explosions and power loss, is about to dive nose-first into the Sierra Leone coastline.

You set the remaining plasma leader to repel, and push outwards to tear yourself free. A large of the Kestrel's halfmelted bow spludges off, and you start to extract yourself from the mess that was a battleship.

"Come on...Come on!!!"

*Allow me.*

Whips of liquid metal wrap around your free arm and neck, and Dumi pulls with all his might as you boost free. The Raioh rips itself from the ship and flies back into the sky, as the Kestrel hits the ground below, disintengrates into a pile of scrap, then explodes, showering you with chunks of debris.

You hear Irm's yelp of joy. "That did it! The bastards are retreating!!"

"All thanks to me, of course!!"

"Well, I won't say that wasn't impressive, Katina, but you certainly earned your victory, given how the Raioh looks right now..."

---

The Raioh's systems may be intact, but the armor isn't in good shape at all. The legs are still covered in the molten remains of the EFA ship, which has seeped into the joints in area, and the back and arms have been peppered with shrapnel. All in all, it looks like several days work to get it combat-worthy.

"...It could be worse..."

Irm facepalms. "Well, I suppose it serves us right for taking on an entire EFA fleet."

"We did it to save our allies! These are nothing but honor scars!"

"...I guess. But our mech complement is not looking that well right now..."

"Really?"

"The Soulgain is still a wreck, the Guarlion needs frame repair, and Rio and Ryoto still haven't finished this mad scheme of Kais to make an elite Gespenst. We're going to be relying heavily on Masaki and Ryuune in the coming battles, if this keeps up."

"What's wrong with that?"

"...I've been spending way too much time with Kai. My sense of trust is shot."

---

Colonel Van Vat Tran turns his grizzled visage to you as you cross onto his ship. He seems like he might be about to break into a smile, but can't force his mouth to go through with it.

"Well well, I certainly didn't expect Mauser's peons to come to our aid. A nice job you did on the Feds there, it took them months to build up that force, and you sent them scurrying back to Dakar. I'd like to thank....Is that Bian's girl? Here?"

Ryuune folds her arms and stares down Vat Tran. "I'm Ryuune Zoldark, but not the one you know. I'm from another world. And my friends and I need the help of you and the Shadow Mirrors."

"Another world? What does that mean?"

Irm interjects. "Mr Vat Tran, things have gotten very complicated in the past few days. People have arrived from an alternate universe, and are demanding aid."

"We have no choice! Our universe is at stake!!"

Vat Tran frowns. "I don't take kindly to tricks, and this is just the kind of practical joke that brat in California would pull to twist us into doing her whims."

"Please, Colonel, you have to listen to us! We're in desperate straights, listening to the Irregulars is all we can do."

"...We'll return to base, and I'll have the Old Maid check out your story. Until then, you'll follow alongside, guns in their ports. Understood?"

"Yes, Colonel."

Irm glowers as Ryuune as he turns to leave. She glowers right back.

---

Rio and Ryoto don't looks happy when Irm orders them off one project and onto another. But they comply, and start to repair the Raioh, removing the leg plating to reforge it and clean out the bits of battleship that got stuck there.

You can't help but notice Irm's looking more irritable than usual. You switch to moeface mode.

"Whats wrong, bossman?"

"Urgh... it's just that I'm been reminded what a minefield the DCs politics is like. With Ryuune, Vat Tran, and Junkers all claiming to be the true successors to Bian Zoldarks ideals, working with two seperate factions for a goal we're not 100% committed to isn't the kind of situation I like being in."

"You'd prefer the simple approach, like me."

"Yeah... well, maybe not exactly like you, but all this infighting is getting on my nerves. I really wish Axel would get better so he can handle all this shit."

"Well, don't worry boss, until he does, you have my complete support."

"...That's supposed to make me not worry?"

---

*Any luck?*

"Their research was incomplete, and the data damaged by the destruction, but I was able to synthesise something using our tech."

*Will it work for cellular regeneration? I have someone in need of the technology.*

"I tested it on one of the dead. She's revived, but... its not perfect. She's marked, it'll be obvious she's not human."

*It will have to suffice. What about the Irregular you reported?*

"Actually, he's from this world. A Shadow Mirror, one of their revived soldiers. He resisted, but when he learnt about the test subject, he agreed to work with us. He also brought a mech, which I'm working on."

*Excellent. I'll send you more instructions once I have a better idea of the situation.*

"Remember, I asked for a special treat for all this."

*I remember. You'll get your new body, once we've recovered what we've lost. Then, we can return to the mission...*

---

The Neo DC base in the middle of Ivory Coast is quite impressive, for something that didn't exist 6 months previously. The three Rhinos slowly ease into thier berths, as the Trilobites and Tausendfuessler touch down.

"Ryuune, please, it'd be better if you weren't there to antagonise Vat Tran..." There's a definite tone of pleading in Irms voice.

"I don't care what baggage the old man has with me, I have to be there. We need their help to track down Vindel."

"Can't you trust us to do it without you being there?"

Ryuunes face falls at this. "I... Not this time. This is too important."

Vat Tran meets your group and directs you into the main building. "So...The Shadow Mirrors are in a bad way, then?"

"Unfortunately, yes. The Irregulars have thrown things into chaos, and the only way to solve things is to send them on their way."

"Hmph..."

In a large meeting room, the group is presented with an odd sight, even for them: A tall woman, her eyes just a smidgeon too far apart, her skin just a touch too glossy, her ears set just a little too high on her head.

She speak, the words obviously not following the movement of her lips, being translated by some device. "What is this bunch of monkeys you've brought to me, Vatran?"

"Quiet, hag. We might actually have found a use for you at last."

---

"Interdimensional travellers?? Well... It certainly not impossible. We Zuvorg have tinkered in the area from time to time, but we've never really tried it. There's little point in other universes when space is already infinite."

"So... would you have any way of detecting such equipment, if it were here on earth." Irm raises a hopeful eyebrow.

Aguija's face may be alien, but her rage is unmistakable. "Of course I don't, foolish monkey! You barbarians destroyed most of our technology at the Moon Cradle, along with my allies. Our dimensional fold analyser was just one of hundreds of unique and irreplacable items that were lost!"

Irm tries his innocent face, which isn't very. "Well... maybe you could build another one... maybe?"

"Why should I? Vatran has me working my fingers to the cartrilage, upgrading his mechs and ships. Why would I stop slaving for him to become your slave?"

"Because... the Irregulars might decide to take the technology from you anyway, or just finish you off out of spite."

Ryuune looks wounded, but says nothing. Aguija just laughs.

"And you think I'm not at risk of dying right now. This old bastard would blow out my brains with his metal-thrower pistol in a heartbeat if he thought he could fathom Zuvorg technology himself. You'll have to do better than that, monkey!"

Irm scratches his head, obviously unprepared for all of this. Kai still folds his arms and watches Irm. Ryuune stares holes at Aquija, who ignores her. Vat Tran seems to be almost grinning at the situation.
