## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 23:....IN SPACE!!!!

In our last thread, the team had managed to fight the Cry Wolves and the Hagane to a standstill, though their DC allies had paid a high price. Abandoning Van Vat Trans northern base, they head south to a hidden jungle base, with several prisoners liberated from the Council's organic control devices. However, as Axel Almer finally recovers from his coma, he raises the issue that the EFA are likely tracking them, and could attack them at any point. Dumi suggests that they distract the EFA, by sending a smell team to low orbit to attack one of the EFAs satellites. A small team that includes our 'heroine', Katina Tarask.

WILL KATINA GO ALONG WITH THIS MISSION IDEA? \

"It sounds like a cool idea Dumi, but, really, just the four of us? and I barely even know those Star Team guys."

*I suppose it'll be a bonding experience then.*

"Isn't there any way to bring someone else as well?"

*None of the other mechs have the capability to reach orbit without external boosters. However, I do beleive the Altairlion has a second seat in the cockpit, which is currently unused. We could bring someone along, in a support role.*

"I...I'm not sure. I'd kinda like Ibis along...But I'm not sure what for?"

*Ibis' skill is as a support gunner, not an engineer. I don't see how much she can add to the combat efficiency of a DC-trained team with new mechs.*

"I guess..."

Axel slaps you on the back. "Right, so, get yourself prepped up, and find yourself a spacesuit. I'll get onto Vat Tran and get him to organise the Star Team."

"Deploy to orbit? Already?" Denzel Hammer cocks an eyebrow at his commander. "Sir, we only just got out of one battle."

Vat Tran brushes him off. "And we'll have another on our hands unless we poke the EFAs eyes out. This type of mission is why we got the alien to design the Hyperlion series. Now, get Star-2 and 3 prepped."

"It's not that easy sir, Star-2 is still damaged, its right Tesla drive needs to be replaced completely. That'll take hours."

"I can help with that."

Dr. Sophia Nate, her off-greay skin catching the light in a disturbing way. She holds up what looks like a glob of mercury in her hand.

"A miniaturised Tesla drive should be no problem for the Machine Cells to fix. They can have the Vegalion ready to fly in twenty minutes."

Vat Tran nods approvingly. "Once again, your technology astounds me, Dr. Nate. Once we can mass-produce the Machine Cells, we might actually stand a chance against the Federation."

"Yes...that would be quite a sight..."
