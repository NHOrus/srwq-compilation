# Episode 23

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 23: ...IN SPACE!!!!

In our last thread, the team had managed to fight the Cry Wolves and the Hagane to a standstill, though their DC allies had paid a high price. Abandoning Van Vat Trans northern base, they head south to a hidden jungle base, with several prisoners liberated from the Council's organic control devices. However, as Axel Almer finally recovers from his coma, he raises the issue that the EFA are likely tracking them, and could attack them at any point. Dumi suggests that they distract the EFA, by sending a smell team to low orbit to attack one of the EFAs satellites. A small team that includes our 'heroine', Katina Tarask.

    WILL KATINA GO ALONG WITH THIS MISSION IDEA?

---

"It sounds like a cool idea Dumi, but, really, just the four of us? and I barely even know those Star Team guys."

*I suppose it'll be a bonding experience then.*

"Isn't there any way to bring someone else as well?"

*None of the other mechs have the capability to reach orbit without external boosters. However, I do beleive the Altairlion has a second seat in the cockpit, which is currently unused. We could bring someone along, in a support role.*

"I...I'm not sure. I'd kinda like Ibis along...But I'm not sure what for?"

*Ibis' skill is as a support gunner, not an engineer. I don't see how much she can add to the combat efficiency of a DC-trained team with new mechs.*

"I guess..."

Axel slaps you on the back. "Right, so, get yourself prepped up, and find yourself a spacesuit. I'll get onto Vat Tran and get him to organise the Star Team."

---

"Deploy to orbit? Already?" Denzel Hammer cocks an eyebrow at his commander. "Sir, we only just got out of one battle."

Vat Tran brushes him off. "And we'll have another on our hands unless we poke the EFAs eyes out. This type of mission is why we got the alien to design the Hyperlion series. Now, get Star-2 and 3 prepped."

"It's not that easy sir, Star-2 is still damaged, its right Tesla drive needs to be replaced completely. That'll take hours."

"I can help with that."

Dr. Sophia Nate, her off-greay skin catching the light in a disturbing way. She holds up what looks like a glob of mercury in her hand.

"A miniaturised Tesla drive should be no problem for the Machine Cells to fix. They can have the Vegalion ready to fly in twenty minutes."

Vat Tran nods approvingly. "Once again, your technology astounds me, Dr. Nate. Once we can mass-produce the Machine Cells, we might actually stand a chance against the Federation."

"Yes...that would be quite a sight..." 

---

###SRWQ Mission 23A: IT KEEPS HAPPENING

Anyway, our 'heroine' Katina Tarask has just blasted off into the sky, with her ever-helpful AI pal Dumi, and Setsuko and Toby from the DC's Star Team, to knock out one of the EFAs spy satellites and give the DC and Shadow Mirrors a chance to get to their new base undetected. The jump to orbit will take about an hour.

---

Elsewhere...

"Director, the target group has launched 2 Super Robots and 2 AMs, on a course for a low earth orbit."

"Acknowledged, Black Knight." Yukiko Date turns to the papers on her desk. "What convenient timing, just as these 'orders' come in from Geneva."

Kirk Hamill frowns. "Is it possible theres any truth to them? That Shine was wrong, and these are aliens or some sort?"

"Weren't you listening, Hamill? Shine said they were from another dimension. I think that would qualify them as being not of this earth, wouldn't you?"

"If you really think so, it is our mandate to stop them."

"Our mandate is to keep the human race alive and free of alien influence, Hamill. We've already been compromising on it by not bombing Geneva. Now, we have to come up with a reponse to the Irregulars, and right now, we only know the whereabouts of one group. We'll have to concentrate on them, even if they're mostly Shadow Mirrors."

"An assault, then?"

"No...something more subtle." 

---

"So...Star-3, was it?"

"Er, you can call me Lt. Ohara, and my partner is Lt. Watson."

"You can call me Toby."

"We're supposed to be more formal with non-DC people, Lt. Watson."

"Ah come on Sets, they fought alongside us at the base, they've proven they're on our side."

"Damned right!!" You say. "We're all dedicated to the same thing, knocking down this stupid Federation and... erm, knocking it down good!!"

 "So, ugh, anyway...How'd you guys get in on the whole DC thing, anyway? Tragic past, EFA burned down your house, that sort of thing?"

"...That's a little forward of you, isn't it?"

"That's just how I roll."

Setsuko sighs. "If you must know, I've been affiliated with the Strategic War Research Institute since a young age, and joined the DC when they did. The whole thing was folded into Project TD in the last year."

Toby seems less reluctant. "I'm just one of those grunts that liked the sound of Zoldarks voice, and thought joining him to save the earth from aliens sounded awesome. Mistakes of youth, and all that."

"So... what do you think of Vat Tran? Happy working for him, or would you prefer to be with the sexy girl in California?"

Toby smirks. "A tempting offer, perhaps..."

"Toby! You're engaged!"

"I'm just kidding! Nah, Vat Trans the future of the DC. Ryuunes a politician, and Junkers is just a fangirl for the Branstiens. If the DC is going to survive, it needs a strong military leader like V-V-T."

"Ooh, engaged? That's one I haven't heard in a while?"

"Well, lots of the pilots have girls back at home, mine just happens to have a ring on her finger."

"That does make a difference, you know."

"I suppose... but that's a big reason why we're still fighting. While the EFA is in charge, we're marked as criminals, we can't be with the people we love. We have to bring them down, not just for vague ideals, but because its the only way we'll ever get real lives."

"...That's kinda poignant, Toby."

"I was an arts student, had a fondness for sappy poetry."

---

As the kilometers flash by and the sky dissipates into darkness, you hear a familiar voice in your eardrum.

*Katina... Do you think we'll have anything like enough firepower to survive this?*

"Huh? Well... we kick loads of ass! Look what we did to the Cry Wolves, and the Hagane? And those Project SRX goons! We're doing great!"

*That is still only a small fraction of the EFAs forces, and even with that our mechs took quite a pounding. We were fortunate that things worked out that way, but chance could easily fail us next time.*

"Maybe, but... we're going to be getting all sorts of machine-cell mechs soon! And I'm sure we'll come up with something else!"

*The Machine Cells will soon be completely under the control of Vat Tran's DC, not us, and I can't see us joining him permanently. Allies like the Star Team may be temporary at best. We need to find another way to increase the forces at our command. *

"And do you have any suggestions, Dumi? Oh wait, you're Dumi, you always do."

*I'll take that as a compliment. I'm scanning my databanks, and I do beleive there may be something. Shadow Mirror intelligence apparently had suspicions about a resource satellite, just on the far side of the moon. Reports are sketchy, but apparently they suspected it was some form of weapons factory, belonging to which faction was unclear.*

"Huh...isn't that a bit out of our way?"

*On our current units, without a doubt. But if we were to secure ourselves a proper vessel, perhaps claim one from the EFA, we may be able to make it there within a day.*

So it´s either Dumi or Vat...Or DC Ryuune.

As suspicious as Dumi is, I think he is lesser devil than Van.

Inquire who else we should take along with our forces and where to get the ship.

Do we take Magus or inspector? Would it be wise to take irregulars, if they even accept our invination.

Well, Wodan's not going anywhere without Sophia. It's more a matter of if Sophia should come with us or not, seeing as Wodan's her guard.

As for others who could come with us, Latooni might enjoy breaking away from the main force for a bit. She did say she wanted us to start taking risks, after all. (She also doesn't have to know this was Dumi's plan, and that we're just being strung along by a suspiscious AI. It might diminish her opinion of us.)

If we run the plan past him, Axel would probably want to stay earthside to run things and make sure he can kick Beowulf's ass if he shows up.

Ibis would probably want to go into space, but she's also more inclined to want to stay earthside if she finds out we've got Sleigh. Or we could just take both of them.

We could probably convince Shu to help us, by telling him it's for the greater good if we're better prepared.

And we might as well take Lamia with us. Because she's got huge airbags, so if we hit something in space we can use her as a deflector array.

 "Well, that sounds interesting, but where do we get a ship? And who should come along with us? We'd have to get Lat up here, maybe that chick with the big boobs for shock absorption, and see if we can't get Dr. Na-"

I think we can do it ourselves. With a little help from some pals of mine, of course.

"Huh? You've mentioned these 'friends' before, who are you talking about?"

When I was being contructed at TLI, one of the Shadow Mirrors deep cover agents made friends with me, helped me with my personality development as she worked on my data-gathering protocols. But then she was called away to her duty, and was secreted into the command crew of an EFA vessel. I believe she can get us this vessel, and rendevous with us after we've finished the attack. That'll give us a clear run to investigate this facility. We can meet with her, head there, check it out, and be back at the new base by dinnertime tomorrow.

"R-really?"

I guarantee.

 "Ok then, it sounds like a plan! We'll head there right after we kick some ass!"

Excellent! I'll make arrangements and then organise our battle strategy. This will be a glorious new age for the Shadow Mirrors.
Commander Lefina Enfield had stopped looking at the fleet report monitors. She knew that everything would be autocensored anyway, creating the illusion of a fleet that never did anything, when in actual fact it was responding to a dozen pocket wars at all times. And of course I have to open my big mouth to the wrong people, and get myself shipped to this glorified mail van.

The Eurydice, a Hiryu Mk2, was a step up from a fighter as a scouting vessel. It had minimal crew and a PT bay that was currently empty. It was a joke assignment for someone who'd graduated top of her class from Hawaii, but then, it wasn't skill that determined your place in the EFA Fleet, it was loyalty to those above.

Hence why that whippersnapper is captain and I'm stuck filing reports and pretending this fleet isn't a bunch of glorified thugs for the Geneva bigwigs...

"Captain on the bridge!"

Lefina leaped from the chair and fell into a salute despite herself. "Captain, all stations report situation normal!!"

The quiet, mousy voice again. "No, it isn't!"

"Captain?"

"Command has just informed me of a special mission we will be taking. It is top secret. There will be no communication off the ship without my express orders. Understood?"

"Er...of course, Captain." A special mission? For this ship? How?

Captain Marion Despinis sat in the vacated captains chair and whispered at the helmsman. "Lay in a course for LCO #288, in low orbit over africa. Cruising acceleration, be ready to engage Stealth Shade at my command. This will be our most important mission."

And add a bit of Duminuss for good measure.

This is actually a semi-decent point.

Presuming that Dumi is somehow part of Duminuss, which it may be, the R-verse Duminuss was a victim of circumstances and well-intentioned but was horrible at carrying those intentions out.

Our Dumi's acting too... helpful to be OG-verse Duminuss, so it's probably not that one.

Plus, remember the last guy who hid secrets from us that we then found out about? Kai? I mean, Kai's fairly on the level all things considered.

This man got quadruple 8s.

Listen to him. Having Duminuss in our side would be incredibly awesome. Let's hope Sciencegar "redeems" him like SRW games usually do.

BTW, I wasn't serious about that post, but yours changed my mind

Stupid question, but what actually is a Ridol, anyway?

I'm hoping this is true, Duminass's character got shafted in OG.

Though one could argue Duminuss's character getting shafted was the *point*, since even Dark Brain thought she turned out wrong.

Also, supposedly Duminuss is female. Or at least that's been the general consensus on TV Tropes. >_>

 The Ridol is a multiform weapon that can change shape into multiple melee implements. It's also a Kamen Rider X reference.

Dumi is a he. I'm certain on this.

New thread going up once my router stops being a dick.

 When are we going to do crazy shit like this?

The Mission: sneak into the temple of a maniacal cult and rescue the virginal daughter of a CEO before she is sacrificed to a kraken.
During the infiltration, the intrepid group manages to 'borrow' some white acolyte robes for disguises. Clad in white from head to toe, they stealthily make their way through the twisted passages of the ancient temple.

From ahead one of the group hears muttering and they stop. It turns out they have reached the dining hall of the temple guards who are congregating for the morning meeting/briefing. As the group ponders how to go about passing this obstacle, one of them hears someone approaching fast down the hall towards them. The runners shrink back against the walls and, as the guard runs by, tackle him, incapacitate him, and then the Sam of the group (hereafter known as Mr. Bloodlust) chops off his head!

This minor commotion, though too quiet to be noticed in the meeting, disturbs a room full of 'sacred animals' being kept for sacrifices. In order to silence them Mr. Bloodlust jumps into the room and, using his combat axe, slaughters the twenty or more sheep. He does this with great abandon, spattering their blood and gibs all over the walls in the process (killing with a combat axe is MESSY).

After this little killing spree, Mr.Bloodlust leaves the carnage and returns to the group. As he passes by the body of the dead guard, he realizes he has a chance at a free weapon and, reasoning in typical sam fashion that one can never have too many guns/too much ammo, strips the cooling body of combat webbing (complete with pistols and grenades), and slips it on OVER his robes.

At this point, the group realizes that they have to pass through the meeting room in order to get to the remainder of the temple and complete the mission.

The voices from the guardroom have increased in volume as more people arrive. As the group stands around pondering their next move they hear someone in the meeting call out "Hey! Where's Abdul?"

Glancing down at the combat webbing name badge that says 'Abdul', Mr. Bloodlust gets an idea…

Of course, he consults no one else regarding this cunning plan.

He bursts into the dining hall and yells out, "Somebody killed Abdul!"

At this point, the GM stopped the game. As he puts it "I had fallen to the floor laughing so hard that I could hardly breathe!"

GM: "What the Hell were you thinking?"
Mr. Bloodlust: "Well, I figure they'll all want to investigate Abdul's death."
GM: "Okay, let's imagine this scene. An ork clad in the blood-drenched robes of an acolyte, bearing a bloody, gore encrusted combat axe and WEARING the combat webbing and name-badge of 'Abdul' rushes into a room full of security personnel and freely announces the death of somebody HE HAS MURDERED!
Mr. Bloodlust: (is quiet for a moment) "Ooops."
At that point, three other players passed notes to the GM stating they would take shots at Mr. Bloodlust during the ensuing battle.

Does it surprise you that the character didn't survive?
