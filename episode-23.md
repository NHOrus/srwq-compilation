 For a list of the previous threads, check the Team Phantom Tiger Blogspot page.

 In our last thread, the team had managed to fight the Cry Wolves and the Hagane to a standstill, though their DC allies had paid a high price. Abandoning Van Vat Trans northern base, they head south to a hidden jungle base, with several prisoners liberated from the Council's organic control devices. However, as Axel Almer finally recovers from his coma, he raises the issue that the EFA are likely tracking them, and could attack them at any point. Dumi suggests that they distract the EFA, by sending a smell team to low orbit to attack one of the EFAs satellites. A small team that includes our 'heroine', Katina Tarask.

 WILL KATINA GO ALONG WITH THIS MISSION IDEA? Anonymous Sun 21 Feb 2010 17:08:14 No.4567357 Report 
 But going into space means we won´t be able to Rider kick as awesomely...


Stay on earth, Earth routes are always more awesome.

This is obviously a ploy by Dumi to get us into space for whatever his reason is...

Despite that, I still say we go along with it. It does seem like the most viable option.

 We should do it. But we should also double-check and see if the Vegalion/Altairlion combo has room for a third person.

If it does? If Dumi starts doing... stuff... we get out of there and ride down with Setsuko on our lap.

 Maybe it's due how much shit is going on, but this reminds me of that higurashi scenario where all the problems of previous arcs had to be dealt with at the same time.

Good thing the Inspectors are already dead (omitting Agiha) and there's no traces of Balmarians and Shuras (In before surprise Shura sex), or else this would get even more messed up.

Returning to the thread, go to space. We've been doing anything that Dumi wanted, so why change our modus operandi?

I think we should take Ibis with us, I mean if she do want to go to space, Right? and keeping her from the Redpenst until it is repaired would be good, Not to mention we can evaluate how she handles flyers and space combat mechs.

I don't think SM!Ibis has the same desire to go into space as her counterpart. SM!Ibis's goal seems to be finding Sleigh.

If we're giving one of the Stars the boot to get Ibis, it should be Toby. That way Einst!Masaki can kill him and give Setsuko something to angst about when she comes back.

 "It sounds like a cool idea Dumi, but, really, just the four of us? and I barely even know those Star Team guys."

I suppose it'll be a bonding experience then.

"Isn't there any way to bring someone else as well?"

None of the other mechs have the capability to reach orbit without external boosters. However, I do beleive the Altairlion has a second seat in the cockpit, which is currently unused. We could bring someone along, in a support role."

SHALL WE BRING SOMEONE, OR WILL WE LEAVE THE SEAT FREE?

Fuck. Why are you doing this to us Sciencegar.

Benefits of bringing someone else along: another warm body to build CR with and help out

Benefits of NOT bringing someone else along: one person can't really help *that* much and if Dumi DOES try to pull something we might need that second seat to survive re-entry with people we can trust.

Leave the seat free.
We'll just have to get to know the Glory Stars better, cause we need that escape route should Dumi pull anything.

Ah, But Sleights goal too was to go into space, In order to fulfil her brothers dream that is, Therefore it would be quite obvious that Sleigh is in space.

Not to mention that Sleigh herself would be quite accustomed to space combat thanks to the fact that Project TD resolves around Space exploration, therefore it would be logical to conclude that whatever faction she went to this time asigned her to a spacepost.

Futhermore, Keeping Ibis from discovering the fate of the Redpenst is also adventageous since her discovering its current state would mean that she would break down, And that could manifest into either a state of anger or a depression, Both would impair her piloting abillity.

 Bring Ibis along. Due the reasons i stated in >>4567490. Besides, Someone in a support role is better then no one at all, It´s not like not bringing anyone along helps us in any way.

That's OG!Sleigh. This is SM!Sleigh we're on about, and we've only gotten scraps of info about her from Ibis. Given how different I've made SM!Ibis, Sleigh could be quite different.

(Also, none of them have anything much to do with Project TD in this universe. Filio worked on the Barrelion, not the Calion, and Sleigh didn't have much time for it, it seems.)

Bringing no one does help us though, as it leaves a space free for us in case Dumi tries anything.

Why does the way I've put that make it sound like Dumi's trying to date rape us?

Hmm, Well, Keeping Ibis from the Redpenst is still adventageous, And if Dumi tries something then it means that the Altairlion can still operate a larger capacity then if it was piloted by a single person, Meaning the survival chances for the entire attack group rises.

Ibis being there would only boost our survival in the event she was familiar with the Altairlion.

And the idea of the Altairlion and Vegalion taking on Dumi and a controlled Raioh without any backup's suicide. If Dumi DOES pull something, we need to escape, get picked up by the Altairlion, and then we get the hell away from the Raioh and Dumi as fast as possible.

We get back to the others and then we REALLY make sure that Grungust Neo gets up and running.

Hold it right there, If Dumi can take control of the RaiOh, Why would Katina be able to escape?

After all, Wouldn´t Dumi lock down the cockpit, Making ejection impossible? Futhermore, If Dumi would take controll of the RaiOh, Wouldn´t it activate the LIOH system incapicitate Katina until it is control of the situation?

If Dumi started to do things suspicious but still had plans for us, it would likely try to tithe us over and not do anything as overt as lock down the cockpit. At least not if it thought there was still a chance of us going along with it.

Long story short, if Dumi pulls a fast one on us, provided we realize it before Dumi expects us to, we'd be able to escape, either by ejecting or just getting the fuck out of there the old fashioned way.

 "I...I'm not sure. I'd kinda like Ibis along...But I'm not sure what for?"

Ibis' skill is as a support gunner, not an engineer. I don't see how much she can add to the combat efficiency of a DC-trained team with new mechs.

"I guess..."

Axel slaps you on the back. "Right, so, get yourself prepped up, and find yourself a spacesuit. I'll get onto Vat Tran and get him to organise the Star Team."
"Deploy to orbit? Already?" Denzel Hammer cocks an eyebrow at his commander. "Sir, we only just got out of one battle."

Vat Tran brushes him off. "And we'll have another on our hands unless we poke the EFAs eyes out. This type of mission is why we got the alien to design the Hyperlion series. Now, get Star-2 and 3 prepped."

"It's not that easy sir, Star-2 is still damaged, its right Tesla drive needs to be replaced completely. That'll take hours."

"I can help with that."

Dr. Sophia Nate, her off-greay skin catching the light in a disturbing way. She holds up what looks like a glob of mercury in her hand.

"A miniaturised Tesla drive should be no problem for the Machine Cells to fix. They can have the Vegalion ready to fly in twenty minutes."

Vat Tran nods approvingly. "Once again, your technology astounds me, Dr. Nate. Once we can mass-produce the Machine Cells, we might actually stand a chance against the Federation."

"Yes...that would be quite a sight..."
