# Episode 20

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 24: This plan cannot possibly have a downside. 

In our last episde, aside from a lot of trolling, we blasted off into space to attack the EFAs spy satellites. Along the way, we chatted to Toby Watson about the girl he's gonna marry after the war is over, and our good friend Dumi suggested we take a side trip to investigate a mysterious resource satellite, using a ship belonging to one of his friends.

Sounds totally legit, right?

---

Setsuko comes in over the comms. "Target spotted! It's....bigger than I expected."

The spy satellite looks like a flower, armored petals open around the sensitive observation equipment, which are already starting to close. Large beam turrets pop up on pylons, missile banks emerge, and a set of Rangzen drone fighters pop off the rear of the satellite and begin to drop down to intercept you. 

Toby smirks. "Looks like a tough nut... makes sense, its in such a vunerable location, it needs the extra protection for just this kind of attack."

You grin as the first set of victims approach. "Well, we'll show them that you can't prepare for the likes of us!"

"Dumi, you first! Stars, behind me! We're breaking through!" The formation lines up as the enemy opens fire. Beams and missiles lance into Dumis forcefield, which takes a pounding but holds.

*Quite an impressive rate of fire on those turrets, much higher than I expected.*

"Star-3, Prominence, Speigual!!"

"Star-2, Prominence, Siephard!!"

A storm of missiles fly out of the AMs and arc around the super robots, slamming into the Rangzen squadron, hard. Most of the drones are already gone, with only a few stray scratches on you and Dumi. 

"And now, I'm catching a ride..."

The Plasma Leader snakes out and grabs one of the fighters, and you unceremoniously drag it to you. Placing your feet on its back, you attempt to ride it like a bucking bronco. Except it doesn't buck that much.

*Katina, that fighter doesn't have the thrust to move the Rai-oh effectively.*

"Dammit, stupid weak jet! Pull hardAH!!" A beam lances into the Raiohs torso, blowing off chips of armor.

You check your boobs. They seem to be in perfect working order. You toss the useless surfboard into the path of a beam, and start kicking.

The rapid fire from the Harken Impulse forces the drones to evade as you want them to, though you take some more glancing hits until you draw the circle tight enough to shield you. Then you thrust out your arms, lightning playing across them.

"Counter Thrust!!!"

The enemy squad are thrown violently back, several exploding from the sheer stress of the acceleration. Three are still intact by the time they impact the satellite, and explode nicely near one of the armor plate hinges.

Another beam clips you.

"Star Team, I've made a hole, you thrust into it! I'll handle the turrets!!"

*We'll handle the turrets, you mean.*

"Yeah yeah."

You soak another few hits as you boost in, systems are flashing orange but you're sure the Machine Cells will handle it. The first turret takes a plasma-encased foot straight on, and kindly melts. Dumi flies around the other side, Ridols whipping around and slicing through power couplings and data cables. 

You kick through the pylon of a second turret, grab it with the Plasma Leaders and toss it into a third. Then the missile salvo hits. Red warning lights start flashing around the cockpit. Looking around the satellite, you see Dumi is also under heavy fire, enough that a beam shot gets through his field and scorches a deep gouge in his armor.

Even the Star Team are having issues, barely getting into range to fire heavy missiles before the flak sends them away again.

"Ok, not going so good...OK, switch around!! Star Team take the turrets, I'll handle the armor!"

"Roger!" The two AMs burst off in opposite directions, laying fire into the missile swarms. A network of orange bubbles follows you as you fly around the satellite and ram your fists into the ragged section of armor."

Dumi rushes in to block a beam headed for you. *Katina, what exactly are you going to do now?*

I'm gonna....show them all....MY POOOWWWEEEEERR!!!" In a burst of lighting, the entire panel is wrenched away from the satellite. You drag it out, turn it, and then boost at maximum, ramming the sharp end into the main lens, shattering it. 

*Well... well done. That sho-*

Then you reposition yourself and boost again, wrenching the panel around in the wound, crushing the remaining sensors utterly.

The Satellite is now useless.

Toby lets out a victory yell. "Well done girl. We've nuetralised the missile banks, so we can head for home!"

"Not so fast!" Setuko sounds worried. "I'm picking up an EFA vessel, ending engagement range!! We can't reenter the atmosphere with them firing on us!"

*It's alright. They're friendlies.*

---

"Alright. These are the units we're meant to collect. Open the PT bay doors and prepare to recieve them."

Lefina blinks in shock. "Captain... we just saw them destroy one of our own defense satellites!"

Despinis rolls a lazy eye at her subordinate. "I have my orders."

"Y-yes, captain." This is crazy! Why would friendy units be attacking our own satellites? There's no reason for our own units to be destroying EFA facilities... Unless theres some kind of internal rift I don't know about.

Lefina looks at her captain ever-impassive face. Is she some kind of seditionist? And if so... is that a bad thing?

---

"Wait, what?"

*We're going with them. They're secret Shadow Mirror agents who'll be transporting us to another location.*

"W-we weren't briefed on this..."

*Everyone has to have their little secrets. Now, don't worry about it, you don't have to come with us.*

Dumi turns to you. *So, Katina, ready for the day-trip?*

---

The PT bay of the Eurydice is quite snug compared to the wide space of the Trilobite. The Hiryu MkIIs are quite a downsize from the originals, but make up for it in speed. And thats what you want right now.

As you roll into the cockpit, a comm window pops up, showing a young blue-haired woman in an EFA captains uniform. Her expression is somewhere between passive and bored.

"You are Dumi's ally?" The voice is monotone, and you have to strain to hear it over the settling noises of the Raioh.

"Ugh, yeah. Katina Tarask, nice to meet."

"Captain Despinis. But Marion will do for now. I suggest avoiding the crew, they're still in the dark as to the nature of all this. The Comms officer is getting worried that I'm having him ignore the satellites distress calls."

"Ugh...huh."

"I'll arrange private quarters. Stay out of sight." The comm window clicks off.

"...Is she always like that?"

*Despinis has issues expressing herself. Inside she's very concerned for our safety, but she's mastered her poker face a bit too well. *

---

'Have met friendly forces. Will rejoin you later.'

"...That's it?" Axel looks incredulous. "They head off in an EFA ship, and thats the only message we get from them?"

Irm puts a hand on his shoulder. "I... I'm sure Katina has her reasons..."

"I'm sure she does. What I'm not sure of is whether they're good reasons. I've heard the crew talking about her, Irm. She's a loose cannon, always two steps away from getting you all killed, or drunk. And now she's absconding with one of our best units!"

"Yeah, she's totally stealing your bit, Axel."

"Screw you, Irm. Just because I know how to work effectively alone doesn't mean I don't follow orders."

"Well, we don't need her back right away, and heck, a bit of breathing space might be nice for a change..."

"Maybe... We do have more important things to worry about, like the alien tech, and tracking down Albark. Besides, worst that'll happen, we lose a few units. We've lost plenty already this week, what two more?" 

---

Kai looks uncomfortable in the medical room. "So... They're as comfortable as they can be? And safe from the alien stuff?"

A tired Kusuha nods. "We've removed all trace of the alien matter we can detect, and made them as comfortable as we can. The man hasn't recovered consciousness yet, and the girl... she's still in shock. She keeps demanding we give her clothes, even though she's fully dressed. She's... very uncomfortable with the situation."

Kai nods, his eye betraying emotion his granite face won't. "Th-thank you. As long as they're safe..."

"Do you... maybe want to visit them?"

"I... don't think so. I'm not sure I can look them in the face right now."

Kusuha watches after him as he leaves. Then she sighs, and grabs for the hip flask she has hidden in the medicine cabinet. 

---

"Intruiging..." Shuu looks in wonder at the goop he's extracting from the Cerberus's engine.

Ring blinks. "Is that more of the alien control system?"

"No, it's the power generator. It's absorbing power from the 4 fundamental forces of nature, it quite impressive amounts. Then the earth-tech convertors absorb it for the mechs use."

"Zero-point energy?"

"A similar phenomon, but not quite the same. Dr. Zapad referred to it as 'terminus energy' when I met with him. He was very interested in studying it, but he doubted he would ever find a way to harness it in usable amounts."

"But here it is, a terminus energy reactor, made of alien tech..."

"If the aliens could construct this, then terminus energy, or something like it, must be a natural energy source for them. It would fit with their interdimensional origins. They naturally absorb extra-dimensional power to operate their mecha-sized bodies."

"So Zapad's experiments... could have attracted them here?"

"Possibly... At the very least, I think its safe to say the Tsentr Project is no longer run by humans. But still..."

"What?... Shuu?... You're not thinking of... using this thing, are you?"

Shuu Shirakawa smirks. It's enough to make Ring shiver. 

---

The crew of the Eurydice gawk as you stride through the mess hall like you own the place. Some of them begin to whisper. You start snatching up food from the canteen trays, its reconstituted factory stuff but its better than space rations.

"So...whadda you guys do for fun around here?"

The crewman nearest stares at you as you attack your plate. "Er, miss... Who exactly are you?"

"I'm Katina Tarask. Why?"

"Well, um, Ms. Tarask, there are...rumors going around the ship....they say you were attacking an EFA satellite when we picked you up. Is...is that true?"

"Sorry, above top secret, not on your clearance, if I told you I'd have to kill you, etc. etc.. Damn, this is good gravy."

"Well, maybe you can tell me."

You look up at the EFA commander, a pretty young woman in formal dress.

"Commander Lefina Enfield, CO of this vessel. Forgive me if I'm prying, but I'm a little concerned about the captains reasons for letting you onto this vessel."

WHAT IS KATINA REPSONSE TO LEFINA?

 "Why I'd love to, Commander!" You grin. "We'll have to take this to a more secure location, however...Say my new quarters."

Lefina looks at you a little oddly. "...Fine."

You amble off to the rear of the ship, where you've been given a room by Despinis. There's little to see on the way, the ship seems to be deliberately designed to be as bland and homogenous as possible, and what few portholes you pass show nothing but empty space.

You enter the room and flop down on the bunk. Lefina looks increasingly concerned. "Ms. Tarask, the captain wouldn't say who you are or what your relationship with the EFA was. Given your....actions earlier, I have to ask...what exactly are you?"

I was worried that this was going to turn into a protracted game of guess the verb just then.

She was from New York. Born in Chelsea in the Alpha-verse (although probably not in the OGverse... how many meteors fell in the Shadow Mirrorverse?)

Interestingly New York was destroyed by meteor in the Alphaverse too, but they rebuilt it.

>This is starting to make me really suspicious. Sitting in front of a battleship's cannon and not taking a scratch? There's high defense but this is ridiculous.

It's not that suspicious. Wouldn’t an OG Grungust for example with fully upgraded armour only take 10 damage from most enemy battleships? Admittedly it's more money than you'd expect to be put into it by this stage of the game, even then with iron wall...

Don’t forget it’s got some sort of barrier...a G-Wall or something?

For some reason I always thought it sounded kinda south-american-y.

I always have a big dichotomy with SRW. I usually prefer supers in terms of design and storylines, but nothing beats the feeling of getting your reals to 0% hit chance

 "Heh-heh, don't sweat it girl, very few can stand up to The Fury. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with your lovely captain."

Lefina stops panicking. "...Right. Right. The Captain. I'll bring you to her. As long as you promise me this ship won't be drawn into anything it can't handle."

"Don't worry, commander, you can just sit back and watch the magic."

The walk to the captains office is just as dull and drab, except now the moon is shining through the portholes. You've made good progress in the last few hours.

Lefina lets you into the captains office and then leaves before you can pinch her ass. Despinis turns to you, her face still incredibly stioc. "Yes, Katina, what can I do for you?"

WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SAY TO THE CAPTAIN?

 "So...er...ugh....friend of Dumi's, then?"

A slight pause. "Yes. I made his acquaintance back during his construction, while I was helping design his intelligence-gathering functions. He is quite the personality, for what is supposed to be a machine for tactical support."

"And you, you've been keeping in contact with him even under deep cover?"

"Its not that hard, if you know what you're doing."

"But...why him? Seems at odd choice when there should be other Shadow Mirrors you can talk to."

"There aren't. The main command staff were lost in this Lygeus operation. Any surviving officers where not in my cell structure and their contact details were not available. Dumi was my only link."

"And you think this mission, this wierd asteroid, is worth risking your cover for? What if its nothing, and we end up being chased down by the EFA over."

 "Ok...when will we be getting there?"

"About 4 hours from now. The Eurydice is not a slow vessel."

"What is the deal with her? I thought the Hiryu class were, well, bigger."

"The original Hiryu was a deep space exploration vessel. It made it out past the orbit of Pluto, took some samples, and returned in time for the DC war. 7 more were made as fast PT carriers, but the Space Noah and Peregrine lines made them obsolete. The Hiryu MkII was an attempt to make a vessel that had the speed for fast operations, without the massive expenditure the originals were. However, they only made two, so I'd imagine the line has been abandoned."

"So, if we do run into major shit in this mystery asteroid, will it be much help?"

Despinis frowns slightly, the only facial expression you think she's made this whole conversation. "It doesn't need to be. We just need to get onto that rock."

 "Wait, so, this thing is undefended then? That's a bit odd for a weapons factory, isn't it?"

"The indications are that its a fully automated factory, with next to no actual people aboard. If there are any defenses, they should only be on the outside of it. Once we're inside, there should be nothing to stop us retrieving...anything we find inside."

"I see....So we just need the Raioh to bust through then? Actually..." You twiddle with your earpiece communicator. "Dumi, how's the Raioh doing?"

The Machine Cells are low on energy with the beating it took form the satellite, but it should be in perfect condition by the time we arrive.

"..Kay. Can I get through to Axel here, let him know how all this is going?"

I've already sent him a message, Katina, explaining what we're doing. We can't risk too many signals, otherwise the EFA may pick them up, and we'd only end up leading them to the new base.

 The Asteroid is massive, easily bigger than any space colony, and is made of ominous red stone. From certain angles, the craters catch the light in such a way as to make a skull face. It's not inviting.

Well, we're here. No sign of any activity, except a raised heat signature. It seems the factory is deep inside the rock, to mask all its emissions.

"Any sign of defense turrets, missiles or the like?"

None, although some could be hidden in the shade.

"And are we just meant to drill through the rock?"

We could, but there must be access points somewhere. I'd suggest checking around the southern area, the part that looks like the skulls teeth.

 You mount up and fly over to the asteroid on minimal thrust. The surface is pockmarked and cavernous, and theres a lot of it. Eventually though, you see a glint of metal, and sure enough, it looks like some sort of landing bay. Unfortunately, two of these things appear to be guarding it.

Well, this is unexpected..

"What the heck are they?"

Passive scans imply they're some form of drones, no pilots. Lightly armed and armored, but built for mobility. Without a pilot to hold them back, they could be quite manuverable, assuming their AI systems are competent.
