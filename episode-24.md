# Episode 20

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 24: This plan cannot possibly have a downside. 

In our last episde, aside from a lot of trolling, we blasted off into space to attack the EFAs spy satellites. Along the way, we chatted to Toby Watson about the girl he's gonna marry after the war is over, and our good friend Dumi suggested we take a side trip to investigate a mysterious resource satellite, using a ship belonging to one of his friends.

Sounds totally legit, right?

---

Setsuko comes in over the comms. "Target spotted! It's....bigger than I expected."

The spy satellite looks like a flower, armored petals open around the sensitive observation equipment, which are already starting to close. Large beam turrets pop up on pylons, missile banks emerge, and a set of Rangzen drone fighters pop off the rear of the satellite and begin to drop down to intercept you. 

Toby smirks. "Looks like a tough nut...makes sense, its in such a vunerable location, it needs the extra protection for just this kind of attack."

You grin as the first set of victims approach. "Well, we'll show them that you can't prepare for the likes of us!"

FIRST ACTIONS?

 Shit, we're fighting the Rafflesia. 

Lions take on the fighters, Dumi and Raioh go after turrets. And on a slightly related note, did machine-celling Raioh up mean we can't get DaiRaiOh now, since they're going to be constantly restoring it back to normal?

 Dumi and the Raioh take point. The Vegalion and Altairlion fly behind them. Once we've appropriately drawn the fire, Setsuko and Toby peel away and around us and destroy its weapons.

 ...can I post now?

Continuing my line of inquiry from the last thread, about Ridols. Now, I've never watched Kamen Rider, so bear with me, I may be asking stupid questions.

From googling, they look like the pic, right?
You said the handle comes out of the arm... how? From the elbow following the path of the forearm? From the wrist, sticking perpendicularly out?
Are the handles of the Ridols the hadles used in Bike form?

And >>4568992

If possible, try to keep the Rangzen's in between us and the turrets: if they fire, they'll only hit their drones then, and not us.

Setsuko and Toby can draw off the Rangzens. Hell, Setsuko could probably do it herself, if need be, unless the Einst have tentacle'd them for whatever reason.

Dumi and Katina bumrush the satellite. Between Dumi's shielding and our new Machine Cells, we should be just fine.

 When are we going to do stupid shit like this?

The Mission: sneak into the temple of a maniacal cult and rescue the virginal daughter of a CEO before she is sacrificed to a kraken.
During the infiltration, the intrepid group manages to 'borrow' some white acolyte robes for disguises. Clad in white from head to toe, they stealthily make their way through the twisted passages of the ancient temple.

From ahead one of the group hears muttering and they stop. It turns out they have reached the dining hall of the temple guards who are congregating for the morning meeting/briefing. As the group ponders how to go about passing this obstacle, one of them hears someone approaching fast down the hall towards them. The runners shrink back against the walls and, as the guard runs by, tackle him, incapacitate him, and then the Sam of the group (hereafter known as Mr. Bloodlust) chops off his head!

This minor commotion, though too quiet to be noticed in the meeting, disturbs a room full of 'sacred animals' being kept for sacrifices. In order to silence them Mr. Bloodlust jumps into the room and, using his combat axe, slaughters the twenty or more sheep. He does this with great abandon, spattering their blood and gibs all over the walls in the process (killing with a combat axe is MESSY).

After this little killing spree, Mr.Bloodlust leaves the carnage and returns to the group. As he passes by the body of the dead guard, he realizes he has a chance at a free weapon and, reasoning in typical sam fashion that one can never have too many guns/too much ammo, strips the cooling body of combat webbing (complete with pistols and grenades), and slips it on OVER his robes.

At this point, the group realizes that they have to pass through the meeting room in order to get to the remainder of the temple and complete the mission.

 The voices from the guardroom have increased in volume as more people arrive. As the group stands around pondering their next move they hear someone in the meeting call out "Hey! Where's Abdul?"

Glancing down at the combat webbing name badge that says 'Abdul', Mr. Bloodlust gets an idea…

Of course, he consults no one else regarding this cunning plan.

He bursts into the dining hall and yells out, "Somebody killed Abdul!"

At this point, the GM stopped the game. As he puts it "I had fallen to the floor laughing so hard that I could hardly breathe!"

GM: "What the Hell were you thinking?"
Mr. Bloodlust: "Well, I figure they'll all want to investigate Abdul's death."
GM: "Okay, let's imagine this scene. An ork clad in the blood-drenched robes of an acolyte, bearing a bloody, gore encrusted combat axe and WEARING the combat webbing and name-badge of 'Abdul' rushes into a room full of security personnel and freely announces the death of somebody HE HAS MURDERED!
Mr. Bloodlust: (is quiet for a moment) "Ooops."

 Hmm. An army of grunts between us and our objective?

I'd say LAUNCH ME, DUMI again, but an object in motion stays in motion. And when we're in space, I don't think that's a good idea.

Unless Dumi precisely calculates the velocity so that we'll land on the satelite, instead of passing through it and rocketing off into space.

Come to think of it, how big is this thing again?

The main body is about 100 meters across, half instruments and half manuvering thrusters to maintain this less-than-stable geostationary orbit (real geostationary orbits are thousands of km in altitude). The missiles are on the main body, the turrets on pylons about 30 meters long. The effect is kinda shurikenny.

So, there's really no way to slow down enough to land on the satelite without destroying it and flying off into the endless void of space, huh?

...Come to think of it, the same could be said for an enemy mech as well. Rope one in with Plasma Leaders, get Dumi to hack it's reactor to explode, and engage all your boosters to surf it into the satelite, jumping off at the last second.

Then recover the remaining drones and retrofit them as backup units.

 "Dumi, you first! Stars, behind me! We're breaking through!" The formation lines up as the enemy opens fire. Beams and missiles lance into Dumis forcefield, which takes a pounding but holds.

Quite an impressive rate of fire on those turrets, much higher than I expected.

"Star-3, Prominence, Speigual!!"
"Star-2, Prominence, Siephard!!"

A storm of missiles fly out of the AMs and arc around the super robots, slamming into the Rangzen squadron, hard. Most of the drones are already gone, with only a few stray scratches on you and Dumi. 

"And now, I'm catching a ride..."

The Plasma Leader snakes out and grabs one of the fighters, and you unceremoniously drag it to you. Placing your feet on its back, you attempt to ride it like a bucking bronco. Except it doesn't buck that much.

Katina, that fighter doesn't have the thrust to move the Rai-oh effectively.

"Dammit, stupid weak jet! Pull hardAH!!" A beam lances into the Raiohs torso, blowing off chips of armor.

ANOTHER STRATEGY, PERHAPS?

 You check your boobs. They seem to be in perfect working order. You toss the useless surfboard into the path of a beam, and start kicking.

The rapid fire from the Harken Impulse forces the drones to evade as you want them to, though you take some more glancing hits until you draw the circle tight enough to shield you. Then you thrust out your arms, lightning playing across them.

"Counter Thrust!!!"

The enemy squad are thrown violently back, several exploding from the sheer stress of the acceleration. Three are still intact by the time they impact the satellite, and explode nicely near one of the armor plate hinges.

Another beam clips you.

 "Star Team, I've made a hole, you thrust into it! I'll handle the turrets!!"

We'll handle the turrets, you mean.

"Yeah yeah."

You soak another few hits as you boost in, systems are flashing orange but you're sure the Machine Cells will handle it. The first turret takes a plasma-encased foot straight on, and kindly melts. Dumi flies around the other side, Ridols whipping around and slicing through power couplings and data cables. 

You kick through the pylon of a second turret, grab it with the Plasma Leaders and toss it into a third. Then the missile salvo hits. Red warning lights start flashing around the cockpit. Looking around the satellite, you see Dumi is also under heavy fire, enough that a beam shot gets through his field and scorches a deep gouge in his armor.

Even the Star Team are having issues, barely getting into range to fire heavy missiles before the flak sends them away again.

ANY BRIGHT IDEAS??

Setsuko and Toby are to do barrel rolls while firing smart bombs and lasers.

Okay, not really.

Anyways, we should fall back. Raioh can heal, the enemy forces can't. Buy enough time for our machine to get out of the red, then charge back into the fray to draw enemy fire.

Dumi and the Star team will hang back until all eyes are on us, and then lunge forward from a different angle. Dumi will tank for Setsuko and Toby until they can get in the satellite and shut it down from in there.

I want to say Star Team uses any AMS equipment they might have, chaff, flares, et al. I doubt they have enough for this though. 

Alternate between Star Team and the DGGs plugging away at the turrets. Aggressive passes with Dumi and Katina, taking advantage of our Machine Cells. Split Toby and Setsuko up, they should be fast enough to draw some aggro and keep us from tanking too much and overloading our regen.

 "Ok, not going so good...OK, switch around!! Star Team take the turrets, I'll handle the armor!"

"Roger!" The two AMs burst off in opposite directions, laying fire into the missile swarms. A network of orange bubbles follows you as you fly around the satellite and ram your fists into the ragged section of armor."

Dumi rushes in to block a beam headed for you. Katina, what exactly are you going to do now?

I'm gonna....show them all....MY POOOWWWEEEEERR!!!" In a burst of lighting, the entire panel is wrenched away from the satellite. You drag it out, turn it, and then boost at maximum, ramming the sharp end into the main lens, shattering it. 

Well...well done. That sho-

Then you reposition yourself and boost again, wrenching the panel around in the wound, crushing the remaining sensors utterly.

The Satellite is now useless.

Toby lets out a victory yell. "Well done girl. We've nuetralised the missile banks, so we can head for home!"

"Not so fast!" Setuko sounds worried. "I'm picking up an EFA vessel, ending engagement range!! We can't reenter the atmosphere with them firing on us!"

 "Alright. These are the units we're meant to collect. Open the PT bay doors and prepare to recieve them."

Lefina blinks in shock. "Captain....we just saw them destroy one of our own defense satellites!"

Despinis rolls a lazy eye at her subordinate. "I have my orders."

"Y-yes, captain." This is crazy! Why would friendy units be attacking our own satellites? There's no reason for our own units to be destroying EFA facilities...Unless theres some kind of internal rift I don't know about.

Lefina looks at her captain ever-impassive face. Is she some kind of seditionist? And if so....is that a bad thing?
"Wait, what?"

We're going with them. They're secret Shadow Mirror agents who'll be transporting us to another location.

Besides, unless the Raioh has orbital re-entry abilities, there's really no way to get back without them.

...Unless we use the satellite like a heat shield, and use it to surf into the atmosphere. But that would only really work for one of us, as there's only one satellite.

In R, Duminuss was trying to find its/her/his creator. It needed the Time Flow Engine to go back in time to try to find it, so it attacks Rau/Fiona at the end of either Prince of Darkness/Char's Counterattack and kills everyone. The Time Flow Engine gets triggered and then everyone gets sent back in time five years.

What DOES scare me, however, is, as I realized, if this IS not 100% evil Duminuss? That means it's it's a successful product by Dark Brain.

And I fear for that.

From what I understand, SRWR Duminass was one of those clumsy moe girls who are always tripping over and dropping things, expect instead of dropping something she killed the person who made her.

 The PT bay of the Eurydice is quite snug compared to the wide space of the Trilobite. The Hiryu MkIIs are quite a downsize from the originals, but make up for it in speed. And thats what you want right now.

As you roll into the cockpit, a comm window pops up, showing a young blue-haired woman in an EFA captains uniform. Her expression is somewhere between passive and bored.

"You are Dumi's ally?" The voice is monotone, and you have to strain to hear it over the settling noises of the Raioh.

"Ugh, yeah. Katina Tarask, nice to meet."

"Captain Despinis. But Marion will do for now. I suggest avoiding the crew, they're still in the dark as to the nature of all this. The Comms officer is getting worried that I'm having him ignore the satellites distress calls."

"Ugh...huh."

"I'll arrange private quarters. Stay out of sight." The comm window clicks off.

"...Is she always like that?"

Despinis has issues expressing herself. Inside she's very concerned for our safety, but she's mastered her poker face a bit too well.

Ring blinks. "Is that more of the alien control system?"

"No, it's the power generator. It's absorbing power from the 4 fundamental forces of nature, it quite impressive amounts. Then the earth-tech convertors absorb it for the mechs use."

"Zero-point energy?"

"A similar phenomon, but not quite the same. Dr. Zapad referred to it as 'terminus energy' when I met with him. He was very interested in studying it, but he doubted he would ever find a way to harness it in usable amounts."

"But here it is, a terminus energy reactor, made of alien tech..."

"If the aliens could construct this, then terminus energy, or something like it, must be a natural energy source for them. It would fit with their interdimensional origins. They naturally absorb extra-dimensional power to operate their mecha-sized bodies."

"So Zapad's experiments...could have attracted them here?"

She was from New York. Born in Chelsea in the Alpha-verse (although probably not in the OGverse... how many meteors fell in the Shadow Mirrorverse?)

Interestingly New York was destroyed by meteor in the Alphaverse too, but they rebuilt it.

It's not that suspicious. Wouldn’t an OG Grungust for example with fully upgraded armour only take 10 damage from most enemy battleships? Admittedly it's more money than you'd expect to be put into it by this stage of the game, even then with iron wall...

"About 4 hours from now. The Eurydice is not a slow vessel."

"What is the deal with her? I thought the Hiryu class were, well, bigger."

"The original Hiryu was a deep space exploration vessel. It made it out past the orbit of Pluto, took some samples, and returned in time for the DC war. 7 more were made as fast PT carriers, but the Space Noah and Peregrine lines made them obsolete. The Hiryu MkII was an attempt to make a vessel that had the speed for fast operations, without the massive expenditure the originals were. However, they only made two, so I'd imagine the line has been abandoned."

Who's side is she actually on? Are we even going to be allowed to keep any of the stuff that we're going to be (the only one) fighting for?

Some things we might want to be more worried about.

Also AFAIK in SRWR

Duminas made Despinis, in SRWQ Despinis made Dumi.

 The Asteroid is massive, easily bigger than any space colony, and is made of ominous red stone. From certain angles, the craters catch the light in such a way as to make a skull face. It's not inviting.

Well, we're here. No sign of any activity, except a raised heat signature. It seems the factory is deep inside the rock, to mask all its emissions.

"Any sign of defense turrets, missiles or the like?"

None, although some could be hidden in the shade.

"And are we just meant to drill through the rock?"

We could, but there must be access points somewhere. I'd suggest checking around the southern area, the part that looks like the skulls teeth.

"Woah. I thought I was just imagining the skull..."

HOW DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS? SEARCH FOR ENTRANCE, BASH YOUR WAY IN, OR SOMETHING ELSE?

Play Vestige and tell them to stop fighting while blowing up all of their weapons because Cagalli is crying!

 Search for an opening, I suppose. We want to save all our strength just in case Dumi is wrong and there is something horrible waiting for us inside.

 You mount up and fly over to the asteroid on minimal thrust. The surface is pockmarked and cavernous, and theres a lot of it. Eventually though, you see a glint of metal, and sure enough, it looks like some sort of landing bay. Unfortunately, two of these things appear to be guarding it.

Well, this is unexpected..

"What the heck are they?"

Passive scans imply they're some form of drones, no pilots. Lightly armed and armored, but built for mobility. Without a pilot to hold them back, they could be quite manuverable, assuming their AI systems are competent.

WHAT WILL KATINA DO?

 At this point trying to make comm contact would be best.

Broadcast a short range hail on all channels.

Concur. Lets avoid fighting while we can. Maybe Dumi can befriend them?

If that fails, we can always Befriend them. Pic related.

 Try to contact them while moving closer. Katina doesn't know they're a hivemind yet, so contacting them would seem to be the reasonable option. Is Dumi around?

 Just going off on an unrelated tangent here, but can the Machine Cells rapidly alter the RaiOh's structure? Because I just got an idea for a new attack.

This. Since Dumi is a 1337 hack3r let him hack their AI so that they see us as friendlies so that we may loot the place without any fighting.

Is there any way to get Juergens to our side? It seems that he is trying to get the scorpion sphere which is the power source of Ryuko-o.

 "Well, if they're AIs, does that mean you can hack them? Make it so they see us as friendlies?"

Good idea. I'll just....Ugh....What...

"Dumi?"

Rainbow lights suddenly appear on the foreheads of the drones, and they turn to face your hiding spot.

There are hundreds of them, all linked together....And they're using my systems as a base. How? HOW?!?!

"Dumi, what the hell is going on?!?!" you shout as the DGG-04 starts to spasm underneath your mech.

Tis, Lalia, Despinis, help me!!! IN THE NAME OF THE CREATOR HELP ME!!!!

The drones are flying towards you, arms outstretched, and its obvious they're going to grab Dumi. Your sensors indicate that more have just become active in the landing bay.
