# Episode 13

## SHADOW MIRROR QUEST (AKA SRW Q)

###SRWQ Mission 13: Witches and Bores

You are the Shadow Mirror Version of Katina Tarask, a frilly-dressed nightmare surviving in a world about to be split by war once again. The OG Main Characters have invaded the Shadow Mirror Universe, to prevent a future which will destroy their universe.

Last thread, after running around Brasilia to find fellow Shadow Mirrors Giado and Garnet, you arrived at thier secret jungle base, where your allies had gathered. There are lots of new and old faces, plot twists, and horrible revelations to be had inside.

---
```
There are a couple of possible avenues for Katina to take here:

Talk to Irm and Kai to find out what's going on, and where you're going next.

Go to medbay to check on the wounded Axel Almer.

Find Arado and meet his friends from the other world.

Talk to this new science guy Shuu.

Find this new cool guy who uses the Vysaga.

Investigate the wierd pods that Echidna brought onto the ship.

Help with the wounded.

Round up a whole bunch of people and go to the Mardi Gras, and remain blissfully ignorant of what actually went on earlier.
```
---

You head over to the towering white figure of the Granzon, and see two figures talking at a table covered in maps and notepaper. One, a woman, looks up at you.

"Yes, can we help y-"

"Oh wow!! Former PTX member and head of Mao Industries Ring Mao! Fancy meeting you here!"

"...Yeah, fancy that. And you m-"

"I'm Katina Tarask, Captain Kai's protege, and I was curious as to what you guys were doing here."

Shuu Shirakawa adjusts his glasses and turns to face you. "My lady, our sacred task is nothing less... than the salvation of our entire planet!!!"

"Ooh, saving the world. Sounds difficult."

"Not for someone of my supreme intellect. I've isolated all possible contingencies and united the greatest of sciences to generatemy ultimate weapon of justice. Now all that remains is to strike forth and-"

"Do you need a hand?"

"...Well i'm not adverse to some assistance..."

"Great! So, if you can just help us to build the Neo Grungust, we can have an unstoppable force to save the world with!!"

"Miss, haven't you been paying attention? You are in the presence of the Invincible Earth Liberation Warrior Granzon, the ultimate expression of science as a weapon! What difference will a mere Grungust make to my plans? In the time it would take to build one, the earth could already be cleansed of evil!!"

"...But it'll have chainsaws..." You pout.

"But the Grungust can be the Granzons quirky sidekick!! Irm can pilot it and be all like 'Boss we gotta cut them up with our chainsaws', and you can be all like, 'No, heroes show mercy to their foes', and then the EFA will be dumb and attack you anyway, and he'll have to chainsaw then, and you can be all stoic and conflicted about it while Irm doesn't learn a thing because he's the dumb sidekick who likes fighting too much."

"...If I can spare any time from my grand design, I shall use some of it in an advisory role to assist you. But first, I must chart the Granzon's course to victory. That shall ever take precedent!"

Shuu turns back to his maps and starts scribbling and muttering to himself, while Ring whispers in your ear. "He's just putting on an act, if you just leave the blueprints to your mech lying around where he can find them, he'll practically be begging you to let him make it in a half hour. It was the same way when I asked him to fix mine."

Ring is a little taken aback when you hug her.

"Thank you. Now, do you want to see about this Mardi Gras?"

"Well... uh..." Ring looks over at Shuu, who appears to be attacking a notepad with his pencil, so intent is his planning. "...I guess he's not going to be going anywhere for a while. You know what, sure. I'll organise transport and we can head in to the city."

"Awesome! I'll go find some more victims!!"

You run off towards the hangars, and into the undamaged Trilobite. You head over to the room Arado is sequestered in, hearing voices inside as you approach.

The tempation to make a grand entrance is great, but you decide to listen in before you break the door down.

---

"...on the Shadow Mirror ship?" Arado's voice.

Then a girl, who's voice is familiar. "Yeah. The Wildfalken was trashed, and there was no time to fix it. Then Axel came back and agreed to work with us getting the surviving Shadow Mirrors out. Gilliam asked me to disguise myself as one and sneak away with them, and it worked! But I didn't expect to find you so fast!"

"Yeah, I had a similar experience when we ran into Ratsel. So, the four of us are going to be working with these guys, then?"

"It's either that or Masaki gets lost again." Ryuune laughs.

"Hey!!"

---
	
The kick doesn't quite knock the door off its hinges, but its not far off. Masaki crumples to the floor, clutching his head.

"OK SLOWPOKES!! This isn't the time to be whispering about boys in the corner!! It's Mardi Gras night, and we're going to paint the town... some color it hasn't been painted already!!"

Ryuune, Arado and the girl who looks tantalisingly familiar but you can't quite place look at you agog. "K-k-katina..." starts Arado.

"Don't give me that! You've been cooped up in here too long, you've practically been a prisoner!"

"Uh... I sorta wa-"

"But I'm going to make it up to you by giving you the night of your life!"

The girls face contorts with outrage. "Wh-wh-what the heck did you just say?? You ca... You can't possibly be serious!! How can you say things like that?!?"

"I'm Katina Tarask... Petty sergeant N. Obody, I can do whatever I want!! Besides, I outrank you, and I'm ordering you to come with us for R&R."

Arado starts to mumble as you drag him out of the room. "K-Katina, don't you have to ask Irm for permission. Or bring Kai? Or something?"

"Can't hear you. Mardi Gras."

Ryuune sighs. "Kuro, Shiro, look after Masaki. I'll keep an eye on them."

---

"Ibis!"

"Oh, hey Katina. What's with the big gang?"

"We're going to the Mardi Gras! Wanna come with?"

"Ugh, sure, I guess."

"Great! Where's Subota?"

"Ugh, I think she's in a meeting with Kai, Irm and the Brasilia agents. It sounds kinda important."

Arado pipes up. "Wait, so you give Ibis the option to come, but not us underage kids?"

"Hush."

"I'll have to do things the old-fashioned way..." You grumble as you walk towards the door of the Trilobites meeting room.

*Miss Tarask, I don't think you're going to get what you want this time.*

"Wuh...Dumi, what do you mean?"

*I've been listening in on the conversation, from the vibrations in the walls. They're in a much more serious mood than you, I'm afraid. Irm is confused and rather out of his depth, truth be told. Kai is continuing to manuver himself into a full authority position over the group, with Echidna continually reminding him that he's not a true Shadow Mirror. They're caught in a deadlock between wanting to send a small group to Africa, or simply remaining here until Axel recovers to reclaim command. Should you abruptly enter the room demanding they all go the carnival, I don't think it would greatly improve their opinion of you.*

"Oh... Do you want to come?"

*I'd love to.*

---

You find Russel at the other end of the hangar driving a forklift of parts over to Rio and Ryoto, who are working on a half-dismantled Gespenst.

Ryoto looks about ready to pass out. "Man, how does Kai even know mechs well enough to give us a list of changes this long? I thought pilots just used the damned things, and mechanics were the ones who knew where all the screws went."

"Ack sure, Kai's hardly an ordinary pilot, lad. He was an Aggressor, back when they were still buildin' the first Gespenst, and he woulda been workin' with the design team every day."

"Urgh... I suppose... but still, he's practically asking us to rebuilt the whole thing."

"BAGS!!" You shout to get Russels attention, and make the universal gesture for 'having a few scoops.'

Russels face lights up like you were offering him a pot of gold.

"Hey, where are you going? The whole lot of you? Are you going to the city? I can go to the city too. Wait!"

---

You lead the group outside, where Ring is waiting in a left-over transport truck. "Well, I wasn't expecting quite a turn-out, but there should be enough room in the ba-"

"SHOTGUN!!!"

Several of the group curse at their own lack of initiative.

"Still, is a group this large wise? I thought we were trying to be at least a little incognito."

"Don't worry, no-one will be looking at us. They'll be looking at our float!"

Ring looks confused, then looks up at the giant motorcycle driving out of the Trilobites bay. Somehow, Dumi has managed to change the exterior color to something suitably gaudy, and the Ridol weapons wave been twisted into a decorative lattice, creating an effect just artificial enough to work.

Leaving Ring standing agape, you hop into the cab of the truck. It's a three-seater, and the third seat is already occupied by a young asian woman in a military nurses outfit with Shadow Mirror trimmings.

"Oh... more warm bodies for the charge?"

"Heh-heh, something like that. I'm Kusuha, Kusuha Mizuha. My shift is over, so I thought I'd join the group."

---

The lights of Brasilia fill your vision as you cross the Amazon on the Neo Brasilia bridge. You're soon in the thick of the festival, dodging wayward floats and patches of dancers. You get out of the truck in the only parking lot you can find with free space, dodging a bunch of kids playing soccer. The group seems to be a little split on where to go. Rio, Ryoto, Ryuune, Arado and that girl you've-seen-her-somewhere-before-dammit are headed to a nearby park, where a concert is playing. Ring, Russel, Ibis, and Kusuha are headed in another direction, towards a raucous-sounding bar. Dumi slowly crawls along the nearest main street, placing him directly between the two points. He seems to have attracted a crowd.

---

"Seolla, what are you saying? I wouldn't do a thing like that!!"

"Well how come she keeps implying... things? She certainly doesn't look like the kind of woman who'd say no."

"Wha... What do you take me for? E-even if I was that kinda guy, it just wouldn't be safe to go with her!"

"What are you saying?"

"Well, she's a lot more dangerous than our Katina, I'll put it that way..."

"... Arado, I... I was just worried about you... This mission has been tough on all of us, knowing we might not make it back...I don't want to lose you too..."

"Seolla...I..."

"HEY!! ARADO!!"

"Whu... WAAAGH!!!"

"AH!! YOU PERVERT!! YOU LOOKED AT HER!!!"

"I HAD NO WARNING! I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF!!"

"PERVERTED LITTLE BASTARD!! I'LL PUT OUT YOUR LECHEROUS EYES!!"

"I EXPECT MY BEADS TOMORROW ARADO!!" You chuckle as you tie up the front of your dress. "Now for some liquid entertainment."

You get to the bar and see that the others have settled in already. Ibis is talking with some of the locals and showing them a piece of paper, Ring and Russel are in a relatively quiet corner, and Kusuha is at the bar, negotiating loudly with the barman.

WHO WILL YOU SIT WITH?

Russel should be speaking to us, not Ring, but Kusuha sounds interesting.

Grab Russel and bring him with you as you sit with Kusuha.

Because if you are I approve so hard.

As long as they both remain in the harem.

That's code for something isn't it?!

Of course if she does end up not being a spy, we'll have to get her a Super Robot.
